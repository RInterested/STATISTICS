###DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF PROBABILITY:
<br>

#####CLASSICAL FRAMEWORK:

It defines probabilities as favorable events over all possible events, and it works well when all outcomes are equally likely, i.e. probability of getting a sum of $4$ when rolling of two dice.

#####FREQUENTIST FRAMEWORK:

It measures the relative frequency of an event in a hypothetical infinite sequence of experiments, relying on the law of large numbers.

#####BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK:

Bayesian probability comes in response to the limitations of the frequentist paradigm in definining an infinite sequence of experiments in cases such as $\mathbb P(\text{tomorrow will rain})$, or $\mathbb P(\text{the die is fair})$. In this latter case, rolling the die over and over, will not give an answer to the question - the die is fair or biased with a probability of $1$ or $0$: $\mathbb P(\text{fair})=\{0,1\}$.

The Bayesian perspective is a subjective measure of uncertainty.

Probabilities can be quantified by thinking of a "fair bet". A fair bet could be taken in either direction. For example, if we assess the $\mathbb P(\text{rain})=0.4$, we should be ready to bet on odds up to $\text{odds}=\frac{p}{1-p}=\frac{0.4}{0.6}=2/3=0.\bar6$ that it will rain. So if we stand to win $n=\$10$ if it rains, we should pay up to $m=n\times \mathbb P(\text{rain})= \$4$. In other words, if we pay up to $m=\$4$ to play a game that pays $n=\$10$, the subjective probability is $m/n=\$4/\$10=0.4$.
