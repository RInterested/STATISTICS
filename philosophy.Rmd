####DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS of PROBABILITY (or the NEED for BAYESIAN PROBABILITY):
<br>

#####CLASSICAL FRAMEWORK:

It defines probabilities as favorable events over all possible events, and it works well when all outcomes are equally likely, i.e. probability of getting a sum of $4$ when rolling of two dice.

---

#####FREQUENTIST FRAMEWORK:

It measures the relative frequency of an event in a hypothetical infinite sequence of experiments, relying on the law of large numbers.

---

#####BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK:

Bayesian probability comes in response to the limitations of the frequentist paradigm in definining an infinite sequence of experiments in cases such as $\mathbb P(\text{tomorrow will rain})$, or $\mathbb P(\text{the die is fair})$. In this latter case, rolling the die over and over, will not give an answer to the question - the die is fair or biased with a probability of $1$ or $0$: $\mathbb P(\text{fair})=\{0,1\}$.

The Bayesian perspective is a subjective measure of uncertainty.

Probabilities can be quantified by thinking of a "fair bet". For example, if we assess the $\text{odds}(\text{rain})=1:4$, and we stand to win $n=\$10$ if it rains, we should pay **up to** $m=n\times \text{odds}(\text{rain})= 10 \times 1/4= 5/2 =\$2.5$.  In other words, if we pay up to $m=\$2.5$ to play a game that pays $n=\$10$, the subjective odds are $m/n=\frac{\$2.5}{\$10}=1/4=0.25$. The probability of winning is $\mathbb P(\text{win})=\frac{1/4}{1 + 1/4}=1/5$.

A fair bet could be taken in either direction: in the prior bet, if we stand to pay $\$2.5$ betting that it will rain with the idea of winning $\$10$ if it does, we should also be ready to pay $\$10$ if it doesn't rain in exchange for winning $\$2.5$ if it does. Hunger for risk has no bearing on the concept, which is predicated on expectations:

$\mathbb E(\text{return})=\mathbb P(\text{rain})\times \text{gain} - \mathbb P(\text{no rain})\times \text{loss}= \frac{1}{5} \times 10 - \frac{4}{5} \times \frac{5}{2}=\color{red}{0}$.

The idea is that if we were to place this bet over and over again, the return would be $0$, being a fair bet.
