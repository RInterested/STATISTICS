###COMPARING SAMPLE TO POPULATION PROPORTION:

<br><br>

This question [appeared here](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/50112/67822).

A report says that 82%  of British Columbians over the age of $25$ are high school graduates. A survey of randomly selected residents of a certain city included $1290$ who were over the age of $25$, and $1012$ of them were high school graduates. 
Is the city's result of $1012$ unusually high, low, or neither? 

How should I approach this question? Any help and hints would be appreciated.

**ANSWER:**

First off let me get the algebraic nomenclature out of the way - I find this extremely slippery and often implied:

(i) $\pi_0$ is a reference value assumed to be true. It is not necessarily the population proportion, but rather a *fixed* fraction or proportion to which we compare the sample to. For instance, the problem reads something along the lines: "Is our sample consistent with a population proportion of $\small \pi_0 = 0.7$?"

(ii) $\pi$ (or $p$) stands for the actual population proportion, but it's too bad that we usually don't know it and have to use instead the...

(iii) $\hat \pi$ (or $\hat p$), which stands for the sample proportion. To make things more "friendly" sometimes $p$ denotes the sample proportion...

(iv) $n$ is the number of trials in the binomial experiment (or the number of sampled subjects in a poll).

(v) $\small Y$ number of "successes" ("success" interpreted sometimes like the word "positive" in Medicine - you don't necessarily want it for yourself).

We are done! Well almost...

In our case we have $\small \pi = 0.82$ and $\small \hat \pi = 1012/1290 = 0.78$. And $\small n = 1290$.

The MLE of $\pi$ is the sample proportion, $\hat \pi = \small successes/trials$, and the expectation for the number of $\small successes$ is $n\pi$. The sample proportion is an unbiased estimator of the population: $\small E(\hat \pi)=\pi$ (and $\small E(Y)=n\pi$) and the standard error behaves very similarly to that of sampling distributions of sample means: $\small SE\,(\hat \pi) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}$, remembering that $var(\hat \pi)= \pi(1-\pi)$ (and $var(Y)=n\pi(1-\pi)$).

The test here as Glen indicates is a two-sided one-sample proportion test: $H_0: \pi = \pi_0$ versus $H_A: \pi \neq \pi_0$. Typically, a normal approximation with mean $\pi$ and $var = \pi(1-\pi)/n$ under the following conditions: $n\hat\pi>5$ and $n(1-\hat\pi)>5$. In our case this is clearly met ($\small 1290 * 0.78 = 1006$).

The $z$ test statistic is $\large z=\Large\frac{\hat\pi-\pi_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0\,(1-\pi_0)}{n}}}$. In our case, $z =\large \frac{0.78 - 0.82}{\sqrt{\frac{0.82(1-0.82)}{1290}}}=\large \frac{-0.04}{\sqrt{\frac{0.15}{1290}}}= \small-3.32$, which is clearly significant since `c(-1,1) * qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) = [1] -1.96  1.96`, and `pnorm(-3.32) =0.00045`. This latter expression corresponding to the [R] code for the two-tailed cut-off quantile values fixing the alpha significance level at 5%: $z_{(1 - \alpha/2)}$ where $\small \alpha = 0.05$.

As for the Wald confidence intervals, the calculation is:

$\large \hat \pi \pm z_{(1-\alpha/2)}\,\sqrt{\frac{\hat\pi(1-\hat\pi)}{n}}$. Coded in [R]:

`0.78 + c(-1,1) * qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sqrt((0.78 * (1 - 0.78)) / 1290) = 0.7573946 to 0.8026054`, which does not include $\small \pi_0 = 0.82$.

Since we know the population proportion $\pi$ in this case as being $0.82$ we can use it to construct the confidence interval as: $\large \pi \pm z_{(1-\alpha/2)}\,\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}$, or: `0.82 + c(-1,1) * qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sqrt((0.82 * (1 - 0.82)) / 1290) = 0.7990349 to 0.8409651`. This excludes the sample value $0.78$.
