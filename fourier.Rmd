###DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORMATION:
<br>

We are dealing with $N=6$ points, corresponding to integers from $0$ to $N-1=5$, and the sinusoids are truncated at length $N$. There are $N$ **basis functions** of amplitude one: $N/2$ sine, and $N/2$ cosine.

The **fundamental angular frequency** is given by $\frac{2\pi}{N}$, which can be thought of as slicing the $2\pi$ circle into $N$ equal slices.

The frequency of each sinusoid is determined by the parameter $k$. The frequency parameter, $k$, is equal to the number of complete cycles that occur over the $N$ points of the signal.

Each point on the left column of the plot below is calculated as $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)$ with $n\in\{0,\dots,5\}$. The first plot is for $k=0$; the second, $k=1$; $k=2$ and, finally, $k=3$. The column on the right is calculated as $\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)$.
