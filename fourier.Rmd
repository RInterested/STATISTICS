###DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORMATION:
<br>

This is a great [reference](http://www.dspguide.com/ch8/4.htm).

We are dealing with $N=6$ points, corresponding to integers from $0$ to $N-1=5$, and the sinusoids are truncated at length $N$. There are $N$ **basis functions** of amplitude $1$: $N/2$ sine, and $N/2$ cosine according to [*The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing*](http://www.dspguide.com/ch8/4.htm) by Steven W. Smith, and I'm trying to get the explanation for it [here](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/2213221/152225).

The **fundamental angular frequency** is given by $\frac{2\pi}{N}$, which can be thought of as slicing the $2\pi$ circle into $N$ equal slices.

The frequency of each sinusoid is determined by the parameter $k$. The **frequency parameter**, $k$, is equal to the number of complete cycles that occur over the $N$ points of the signal.

Each point on the left column of the plot below is calculated as $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)$ with $n\in\{0,\dots,5\}$. The first plot is for $k=0$; the second, $k=1$; $k=2$ and, finally, $k=3$. The column on the right is calculated as $\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)$.

The dots in the plots above were simply defined as $(x,f(x))=(0,f(0)), (1,f(1)), (2,f(2)),(3,f(3)),(4,f(4)),(5,f(5))$ with $f(x)=\exp\{\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\}=\exp\{\frac{2\pi}{6}kx\}$. The amplitude is $1$. $k$ was advanced from $0$ to $N/2=3$ for both sine and cosine basis functions.

The [DFT is defined](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/mdft/Mathematics_DFT.html) as:

$$X(k)\equiv \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\underset{\text{time sequence}}{\underbrace{ x(n)}}\; \underset{\text{basis funcs.}}{\underbrace{\exp\left(\color{red}{\mathbf-}i\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)}}, \quad k=0,1,\dots,N-1$$

although also found with a [normalizing $1/N$](https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/Multimedia/node228.html) in front:

$$X(k)\equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\underset{\text{time sequence}}{\underbrace{ x(n)}}\; \underset{\text{basis funcs.}}{\underbrace{\exp\left(\color{red}{\mathbf-}i\frac{2\pi}{N}kn\right)}}, \quad k=0,1,\dots,N-1$$

The minus sign is just a [convention](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/60423/152225) so that the inverse (IDFT) ends up expressed as the sum of positive frequencies:

$$x[n]= \sum_k X(k) \exp\left(i\,\frac{2\pi}{N} kn\right)$$

which is a sum of sines and cosines if we use the [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula):

$$e^{ix}=\cos x + i \sin x$$

<img width=250 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/24579488/aa2c3fc6-16c4-11e7-895a-75ec1194c830.png">

There is another explanation of this convention [here](http://dsp.stackexchange.com/a/19007/27561). The only important part is that the direct and inverse DFT have opposite signs.

We definine $w_N$ - the [**twiddle factor**](http://www.lsi-contest.com/2012/shiyou_3-2e.html):

$$\large w_N \equiv e^{-i\,\frac{2\pi}{N}}$$

which has periodic properties. The $N$ power of the twiddle factor is:

$$w_N^N=e^{-i\,\frac{2\pi}{N}N}=e^{-i2\pi}=1$$

thanks to Euler's identity, $e^{i\pi}+1 = 0$, and $e^{-i2\pi}=1$.

And $w_N^{k+N}=w_N^k$ because $w_N^{k+N}=w_N^k\,w_N^N$.

The exponents are $w_N^{kn}=\left(e^{-i\,\frac{2\pi}{N}}\right)^{kn}$.

It makes sense then to express the DFT as a matrix. The $N=4$ (four-point) DFT is especially cool, because splitting the circle into quadrant result in pure sine and cosine waves - in the complex plane, we are either along the $x$-axis (real / cosine), or along the $y$-axis (imaginary /sine). The matrix (really well [explained by Professor Stang](https://youtu.be/M0Sa8fLOajA?t=24m21s)) then simplifies nicely as:

$$W = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 \omega^0  & \omega^0  &\omega^0  &\omega^0 \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^1  &\omega^2  &\omega^3  \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^2  &\omega^4  &\omega^6  \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^3  &\omega^6  &\omega^9  \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &  1 &  1 &  1\\
1 &  -i & -1 & i\\
1 & -1 &  1 & -1\\
1 & i & -1 &  -i\end{bmatrix}$$

where $\omega = e^{-\frac{\pi i}{2}} = -i.$

The DFT would therefore be calculated as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X[0]\\X[1]\\X[2]\\X[3]
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
 \omega^0  & \omega^0  &\omega^0  &\omega^0 \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^1  &\omega^2  &\omega^3  \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^2  &\omega^4  &\omega^6  \\
 \omega^0  & \omega^3  &\omega^6  &\omega^9  \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x[0]\\x[1]\\x[2]\\x[3]
\end{bmatrix}
$$

leading to the [Fast Fourier (FFT)](http://www.lsi-contest.com/2012/shiyou_3-2e.html) expedited method.

There is a great insight found [here](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/mdft/Mathematics_DFT.html):

Defining $s_k(n)\equiv e^{i\,\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}$.

>Finally, we need to understand what the summation over $n$ is doing in the definition of the DFT. We'll learn that it should be seen as the computation of the inner product of the signals $x$ and $s_k$ defined above, so that we may write the DFT, using inner-product notation, as

$$ X(k) \equiv \langle x,s_k\rangle$$

>where  $s_k(n) \equiv e^{j{2\pi n k/N}}$ is the sampled complex sinusoid at (normalized) radian frequency  $\omega_k T=2\pi k/N$, where $T$ is the [sampling interval or sampling period](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/mdft/DFT_Definition.html), and the inner product operation  $\left<\,\cdot\,,\,\cdot\,\right>$ is defined by
$\left<x,y\right> \equiv \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n) \overline{y(n)}$.

This idea of DFT as a measure of similarity between the sampled signal and the sinusoids is very well explained on [this video](https://youtu.be/B2iUDBZzBpY), containing a great example:

####2D DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM:

Now we are going to need two frequency parameters as explained [here](https://youtu.be/nyk75ufbP74) - so instead of $k$, now we have $k$ and $l$.We will also have two indices for the points - so we have not just $n$, but $n$ and $m$:

$$X[k,l]=\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\,\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\,x(m,n)\,\exp\left(-i\,2\pi\left(\frac{km}{M}+\frac{ln}{N}\right)\right)$$

#### MATHLAB to IMAGEJ CORRESPONDENCE:

In this toy example, I am aiming at producing the 2D DFT of the following 256 x 256 png image:

To be able to understand the output easily, I try to convert this image into a 256 x 256 image, eliminating color information:

    Im = imread('circ.png');
    pkg load image
    Im = rgb2gray(Im);
    figure, imshow(Im)
    
<img width=100 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/24640837/5db7c560-18c8-11e7-9272-9229f6ed47f6.png">

After this bookkeeping preliminaries I run:

    A = fft2(double(Im));
    
    
Here are the plots:
    
    subplot(131);
    h = imshow(Im);
    h2 = get(h,'Parent');
    set(h2,'YDir','Normal');
    axis equal tight;
    title("Circle");

    subplot(132);
    h = imshow(abs(fftshift(A)),[24 100]);
    h2 = get(h,'Parent');
    set(h2,'YDir','Normal');
    axis equal tight;
    title("2D FFT Magnitude");

    subplot(133);
    h = imshow(angle(fftshift(A)),[-pi pi]);
    h2 = get(h,'Parent');
    set(h2,'YDir','Normal');
    axis equal tight;
    title("2D FFT Phase");

<img width=500 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/24640869/b840abfa-18c8-11e7-999a-5143aedcc55e.png">

Now I take the same image, and analyze it with ImageJ, checking the output at point `(157, 96)`, like this:

<img width=500 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/24640903/eeb34a30-18c8-11e7-8cfb-835bbf773c72.png">

So the magnitude is going to be $\sqrt{7.448^2 + 10.458^2} = 12.83.$

And the phase, $\arctan(-10.458 / 7.448) = 54.54^\circ.$

The question is, [**How can I get these values out of the `fft2()` output?**](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43196792/4089351)

Here are a few observations which should clarify the scaling used:

- ImageJ's X and Y positions are 0-based whereas Matlab's indexing is 1-based.
- Incrementing ImageJ's X position corresponds to incrementing the column index in Matlab, and incrementing ImageJ's Y position corresponds to incrementing the row index in Matlab, so that an `(X,Y)` coordinate pair in ImageJ will be found at index `(Y+1,X+1)` in Matlab.
- ImageJ displays the image with the 0 frequency component in the middle of the image, so measurements are effectively made on the equivalent of `fftshift(Im)`
- ImageJ scales the 0-255 grayscale values to floating point values in the 0.0-1.0 range (i.e. scaling all values by dividing by 255)

So with that in mind, we have:

    >> Ashifted = fftshift(A);
    >> Ashifted(97,158)/255
    ans =   7.4484 - 10.4582i


which correspond exactly to your illustrated measurements of the real and imaginary parts at positions `(X,Y) = (157,96)` and `(X,Y) = (164,92)` respectively.

Note that by the linearity property of the FFT, you could also divide the input and get the same results:

    A = fft2(double(Im)/255.0);
    >> Ashifted = fftshift(A);
    >> Ashifted(97,158)
    ans =   7.4484 - 10.4582i

[**The next question is how to extract the direction (theta) and frequency (e.g. pixels/cycle)?**](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43197349/4089351)

Let say you have a particular pixel `A(i,j)`, then the direction and frequency in pixels/cycle (as similarly obtained by ImageJ) can be obtained using the following:

    center = size(A)/2 + 1;
    dx = (j-center(2))/size(A,2);
    dy = (center(1) - i - 1)/size(A,1);

    direction = atan2(dy, dx); %in radians
    frequency = 1/sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

####EXAMPLE COMPARING MATLAB AND IMAGEJ OUTPUTS:

<img width=700 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/24681151/f5ccae76-1961-11e7-94e9-bf4af345313a.png">


**with ImageJ:**

    Frequency = 10.24 pixels/cycle (25 cycles)
    Theta (direction) = 16.26 degrees
    Real part = -1.255
    Imaginary part = 10.142
    Phase = arctan(10.142 / -1.255) = -82.95 degrees
    Magnitude = sqrt(10.142^2 + 1.255^2) = 10.2194

and **with Matlab:**

    Im = imread('circ.png');
    pkg load image
    Im = rgb2gray(Im);
    
    A = fft2(double(Im) / 255);
    Ashifted = fftshift(A);
    Ashifted(121,153)
    
    i = 121;
    j = 153;
    
    center = size(A) / 2 + 1;
    dx = (j - center(2)) / size(A,2);
    dy = (center(1) - i - 1) / size(A,1);
    
    direction = (atan2(dy, dx))
    dir_degrees = direction * (360 / (2*pi)) 
    frequency = 1 /sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

The output:

    ans =  -1.2553 + 10.1425i
    direction =  0.28379
    dir_degrees =  16.260
    frequency =  10.240
