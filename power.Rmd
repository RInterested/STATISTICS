These plots show the dependence of power on the true mean of the alternative hypothesis: the closer it is to the mean of $H_o$ the less power to reject $H_o$ when it is false. At its limit, when both means coincide, the power becomes identical to the $\alpha$ risk.

These plots show the dependence of power on the true mean of the alternative hypothesis: the closer it is to the mean of $H_o$ the less power to reject $H_o$ when it is false. At its limit, when both means coincide, the power becomes identical to the $alpha$ risk.

The probability of a type II error is $\beta$. In other words, it is the probability of *not* rejecting $H_o$ when it is false.

Therefore, probability of rejecting $H_o$ when it is false will be $1 - \beta$. And this is exactly the definition of *POWER*:

<br>

$POWER \, = \, 1\,-\,\beta$

<br>

Power is exactly the probability that the test statistic lies in the rejection region *under* the premise that $H_a$ is correct.

For a single-group mean test we are comparing a normalized mean to a $t$ quantile to test if the group mean belongs to a different population, i.e. $H_a: \mu_a>\mu_o$.

<br>

$p\,\Big(\Large\frac{\bar X - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,> t_{1-\alpha,\,n-1}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$

<br>

However, if $n$ is large we can do instead normal calculations:

<br>

$p\,\Big(\Large\frac{\bar X - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,> z_{1-\alpha}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$

<br>

$\Large=\,p\Big(\Large\frac{\bar X - \mu_a \, + \mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,> z_{1-\alpha}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$

<br>

$\Large=\,p\Big(\Large\frac{\bar X - \mu_a}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} > \,z_{1-\alpha}\, -\frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$

<br>

$\Large=\,p\Big(Z> \, z_{1-\alpha} -\frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$


<br>

RELATIONSHIPS:

1. Power goes up as $\alpha$ is larger.

2. Power of a one-sided test is greater than the power of the associated two-sided test - just think of it in terms of smaller $\alpha$ cuts ($\alpha/2$) 

3. Power goes up the further $\mu_a$ gets away from $\mu_o$.

4. Power goes up as $n$ goes up.
