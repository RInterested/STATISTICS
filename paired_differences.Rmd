###PAIRED $t$ TEST:

<br><br>

We can compare the difference in mean between paired observations by just focusing on the whether the difference is consistent with zero as though it was a single group: $H_o: \mu_{diff} = 0$ and $H_a: \mu_{diff} \neq 0$.

In this case the $t$ statistic is:

<br><br>

$\Large t\,statitic=\frac{\bar X - 0}{SD_{diff}\,\sqrt{n_{diff}}} \geq \,qt\,(0.95,\, n_{diff} - 1)$

Of course, for a large sample we could also use a z statistic.

<br>

It's a good thing for paired data to get the **Mean-Difference Plot":

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(RCurl)
x <- getURL("http://rinterested.github.io/statistics/dat.csv")
dat <- read.csv(text = x, header=T)
attach(dat)
dat
mean <- (Before + After)/2
diff <- After - Before
plot(mean, diff, pch = 19, col= "blue4", xlab = "Mean Before & After", ylab = "Difference Before & After")
abline(h=mean(diff), col="turquoise", lwd = 3)
```
