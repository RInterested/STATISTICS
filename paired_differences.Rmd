###PAIRED $t$ TEST:

<br><br>

We can compare the difference in mean between paired observations by just focusing on the whether the difference is consistent with zero as though it was a single group: $H_o: \mu_{diff} = 0$ and $H_a: \mu_{diff} \neq 0$.

In this case the $t$ statistic is:

<br><br>

$\Large t\,statitic=\frac{\bar X - 0}{SD_{diff}\,\sqrt{n_{diff}}} \geq \,qt\,(0.95,\, n_{diff} - 1)$

Of course, for a large sample we could also use a z statistic.
