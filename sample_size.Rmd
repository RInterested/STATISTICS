###SAMPLE SIZE:
<br>

From [Brian Caffo's Coursera biostatistics video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics-2/lecture/JLyrB/calculating-power):

>Suppose that we wanted to detect an increase in mean RDI (respiratory disturbance index in the context of sleep apnea) of at least $2 \text{ events/hour}$ above $30$. Assume normality and that the sample in question has a standard deviation of $4$. What would be the power if we took a sample of $16?$

$$Z_{1-\alpha}=1.645$$

and 

$$\frac{\mu_a - 30}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{2}{4/\sqrt{16}}=2$$

Therefore, 

$$\Pr(Z>1.645-2)=\Pr(Z>-0.355)=64\%$$

What $n$ sample size would be required to get a power of $80\,\%$ (a common benchmark in the sciences)?

For a one-sided test ($H_a: \mu_a > \mu_o$):

<br>

$0.8=\Pr\left(Z> \, z_{1-\alpha} -\frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=\mu_a\right)$


We set $z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}} = z_{0.2}$ and solve for $n$ for any value of $\mu_a$. We pick $\mu_a$ as the smallest effect that we would reasonably like to detect.

In the cases of $H_a:\mu_a \neq \mu_o$ we can just take one of the sides but with $\alpha/2$.
