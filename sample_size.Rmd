### POWER AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS:


From [Brian Caffo's Coursera biostatistics video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics-2/lecture/JLyrB/calculating-power):

#### STATISTICAL POWER CALCULATION:


If we know $\sigma$ and $n$ is large, and with $\beta$ being the type II error rate, the power is $1-\beta$

\begin{align}
1-\beta &= \Pr\left(\frac{\bar X -\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}   > z_{1-\alpha} \mid \mu = \mu_a \right)\\[3ex]
&= \Pr\left(\frac{\bar X-\mu_a +\mu_a -\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}   > z_{1-\alpha} \mid \mu = \mu_a \right)\\[3ex]
&=\Pr\left(\frac{\bar X -\mu_a}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}   > z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \mid \mu = \mu_a \right)\\[3ex]
&= \Pr\left(Z   > z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \mid \mu = \mu_a \right)
\end{align}


>Suppose that we wanted to detect an increase in mean of the RDI (respiratory disturbance index) in the context of sleep apnea of at least $2\small \text{ events/hour}$ above $30$. Assume normality and that the sample in question has a standard deviation of $4$. What would be the power if we took a sample of $16?$

$$Z_{1-\alpha}=1.645$$
or...

```{r}
qnorm(0.95)
```


and with $\mu_a$ being the true mean under the alternative hypothesis (i.e. sleep-apnea carries along a higher number of RDI with a mean of 32):

$$\frac{\mu_a - 30}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{2}{4/\sqrt{16}}=2$$

Therefore, 

$$\Pr(Z>1.645-2)=\Pr(Z>-0.355)=64\%$$

or...

```{r}
1 - pnorm(qnorm(0.95) - 2/(4 / sqrt(16)))
```

#### STATISTICAL SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:

What $n$ sample size would be required to get a power of $80\,\%$ (a common benchmark in the sciences)?

For a one-sided test ($H_a: \mu_a > \mu_0$):


$$0.8=\Pr\left(Z> \, z_{1-\alpha} -\frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}} \mid \mu=\mu_a\right)$$

which implies that 

$$z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}} = z_{0.20}$$

We set $z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}} = z_{0.2}$ and solve for $n$ for any value of $\mu_a$:

$$n=\left( \sigma \frac{z_{1-\alpha} - z_{0.20}}{\mu_a -\mu_0} \right)^2$$

We pick $\mu_a$ as the smallest effect that we would reasonably like to detect.


In the cases of $H_a:\mu_a \neq \mu_0$ we can just take one of the sides but with $\alpha/2$.

For the example above:

```{r}
(n <- (4*(qnorm(0.95)-qnorm(0.2))/2)^2)
```

which would indeed carry an $80\%$ power:

```{r}
1 - pnorm(qnorm(0.95) - 2/(4 / sqrt(n)))
```
