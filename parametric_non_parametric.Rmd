### ON THE CONFUSION BETWEEN PARAMETRIC AND NON-PARAMETRIC:
<br>

From Introduction to Statistical Inference by JC Kiefer, where $\Omega$ apparently denotes a class of $\text{df}$ (df  denoting distribution function), as opposed to sample space:

These are comments on [this post in CV](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/18450/67822):

>"One of the Professor told me that 'Chi-Square test' has both behaviors (i.e., parametric and nonparametric as well). I did not understand at all, why 'chi square test' has both behaviors."


It's not the test that's parametric, it's the model that is. Chi-square distributions arise in both situations (in a natural way in the general linear model with Normal distributional assumptions, and as an approximation for a difference of log likelihoods--both of them parametric applications--and also as an approximation for the multinomial distributions that arise in many nonparametric applications), so there are many different tests sharing the name "chi-squared." This is probably what suggested your professor's comment.

>"Does your last comment mean that chi-square test for goodness-of-fit is nonparametric?"

In the sense described under "hypothesis testing" in [here](stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/chigf.htm), yes it is nonparametric, because it applies to [almost] any distribution. 

"Non-parametric" does not mean "no distributional assumptions." On the contrary, the most well-known non-parametric tests all make distributional assumptions.
