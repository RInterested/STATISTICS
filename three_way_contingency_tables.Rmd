### Three-Way Contingency Table:

---

From [this post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/266033/67822), and making reference to [this other post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/8378/67822), [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwl-HpVJ_5PeaS1BN05zeWw5TVE/view?usp=sharing), and [page 9 of this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwl-HpVJ_5PeYjV1UzY1eFBDV1E/view?usp=sharing).


The formula for the standardized residuals is:

$$\text{Pearson's residuals}\,=\,\frac{\text{Observed - Expected}}{ \sqrt{\text{Expected}}}$$

the sum of squared standardized residuals is the chi square value. 

Assuming a level of significance of $0.05$, the cutoff limit for statistical significance is $\pm1.96$, or an absolute value greater than $1.96.$

The fact that this is a three-way contingency table complicates the interpretation, which is very nicely explained in @roando2's answer. 

Here is a simulation with a made-up table that resembles the OP to clarify the calculations:

    tab_df = data.frame(expand.grid(
      age = c("15-24", "25-39", ">40"),
      attitude = c("no","moderate"),
      memory = c("yes", "no")),
      count = c(1,4,3,1,8,39,32,36,25,35,32,38) ) 
    (tab = xtabs(count ~ ., data = tab_df))

    , , memory = yes
           attitude
    age     no moderate
      15-24  1        1
      25-39  4        8
      >40    3       39
    , , memory = no
           attitude
    age     no moderate
      15-24 32       35
      25-39 36       32
      >40   25       38
    
    require(vcd)
    mosaic(~ memory + age + attitude, data = tab, shade = T)
    expected = mosaic(~ memory + age + attitude, data = tab, type = "expected") 
    expected
    
    # Finding, as an example, the expected counts in >40 with memory and moderate att.:

    over_forty = sum(3,39,25,38)
    mem_yes = sum(1,4,3,1,8,39)
    att_mod = sum(1,8,39,35,32,38)
    exp_older_mem_mod = over_forty * mem_yes * att_mod / sum(tab)^2
    
    # Corresponding standardized Pearson's residual:
    
    (39 - exp_older_mem_mod) / sqrt(exp_older_mem_mod) # [1] 6.709703

It is interesting to compare the graphical representation to the results of the Poisson regression, which illustrates perfectly the English interpretation in @rolando2 's answer:

> fit <- glm(count ~ age + attitude + memory, data=tab_df, family=poisson())
> summary(fit)

    Call:
    glm(formula = count ~ age + attitude + memory, family = poisson(), 
        data = tab_df)
