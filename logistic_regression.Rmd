###INTERPRETATION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION RESULTS:
<br>

***QUESTION:***

(Initially posted [here](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/136193/67822))

I ran a linear regression of acceptance into college against SAT scores and family / ethnic background. The data are fictional. This is a follow-up on a prior question, already answered. The question focuses in the gathering and interpretation of odds ratios when leaving the SAT scores aside for simplicity. 

The variables are `Accepted` (0 or 1) and `Background` ("red" or "blue"). I set up the data so that people of "red" background were more likely to get in:

    fit <- glm(Accepted~Background, data=dat, family="binomial")
    exp(cbind(Odds_Ratio_RedvBlue=coef(fit), confint(fit)))
    
                            Odds_Ratio_RedvBlue             2.5 %       97.5 %
    (Intercept)             0.7088608                     0.5553459   0.9017961
    Backgroundred           2.4480042                     1.7397640   3.4595454


Questions:

1. Is 0.7 the odd ratio of a person of "blue" background being accepted? I'm asking this because I also get 0.7 for "`Backgroundblue`" if instead I run the following code:

        fit <- glm(Accepted~Background-1, data=dat, family="binomial")
        exp(cbind(OR=coef(fit), confint(fit)))

2. Shouldn't the odds ratio of "red" being accepted ($\rm Accepted/Red:Accepted/Blue$) just the reciprocal: ($\rm OddsBlue = 1 / OddsRed$)?

***ANSWER:***

I've been working on answering my question by calculating manually the odds and odds ratios:

    Acceptance   blue	         red	        Grand Total
    0	         158	         102	            260
    1	         112	         177	            289
    Total	     270	         279	            549

So the *Odds Ratio* of getting into the school of Red over Blue is: 

$$
\frac{\rm Odds\ Accept\ If\ Red}{\rm Odds\ Acccept\ If\ Blue} = \frac{^{177}/_{102}}{^{112}/_{158}} = \frac {1.7353}{0.7089} = 2.448
$$ 

And this is the `Backgroundred`return of: 

    fit <- glm(Accepted~Background, data=dat, family="binomial")
    exp(cbind(Odds_and_OR=coef(fit), confint(fit)))
    
                          Odds_and_OR                         2.5 %      97.5 %
    (Intercept)             0.7088608                     0.5553459   0.9017961
    Backgroundred           2.4480042                     1.7397640   3.4595454

At the same time, the `(Intercept)`corresponds to the numerator of the *odds ratio*, which is exactly the *odds* of getting in being of 'blue' family background: $112/158 = 0.7089$.

If instead, I run:

    fit2 <- glm(Accepted~Background-1, data=dat, family="binomial")
    exp(cbind(Odds=coef(fit2), confint(fit2)))

                            Odds            2.5 %      97.5 %
    Backgroundblue     0.7088608        0.5553459   0.9017961
    Backgroundred      1.7352941        1.3632702   2.2206569

The returns are precisely the *odds* of getting in being 'blue': `Backgroundblue` (0.7089) and the *odds* of being accepted being 'red':  `Backgroundred` (1.7353). No *Odds Ratio* there. Therefore the two return values are not expected to be reciprocal.

Finally, How to read the results if there are 3 factors in the categorical regressor?

Same manual versus [R] calculation:

I created a different fictitious data set with the same premise, but this time there were three ethnic backgrounds: "red", "blue" and "orange", and ran the same sequence:

First, the contingency table:

    Acceptance	blue	orange	red	  Total
    0	          86	    65	130	    281
    1	          64	    42	162	    268
    Total	     150	   107	292	    549

And calculated the *Odds* of getting in for each ethnic group:

 - Odds Accept If Red = 1.246154;
 - Odds Accept If Blue = 0.744186; 
 - Odds Accept If Orange = 0.646154

As well as the different *Odds Ratios*:

 - OR red v blue = 1.674519; 
 - OR red v orange = 1.928571; 
 - OR blue v red = 0.597186; 
 - OR blue v orange = 1.151717; 
 - OR orange v red = 0.518519; and
 - OR orange v blue = 0.868269  

And proceeded with the now routine logistic regression followed by exponentiation of coefficients:

    fit <- glm(Accepted~Background, data=dat, family="binomial")
    exp(cbind(ODDS=coef(fit), confint(fit)))

                          ODDS     2.5 %   97.5 %
    (Intercept)      0.7441860 0.5367042 1.026588
    Backgroundorange 0.8682692 0.5223358 1.437108
    Backgroundred    1.6745192 1.1271430 2.497853

Yielding the *odds* of getting in for "blues" as the `(Intercept)`, and the *Odds Ratios* of Orange versus Blue in `Backgroundorange`, and the OR of Red v Blue in `Backgroundred` .

On the other hand, the regression without intercept predictably returned just the three independent *odds*:

    fit2 <- glm(Accepted~Background-1, data=dat, family="binomial")
    exp(cbind(ODDS=coef(fit2), confint(fit2)))

                          ODDS     2.5 %    97.5 %
    Backgroundblue   0.7441860 0.5367042 1.0265875
    Backgroundorange 0.6461538 0.4354366 0.9484999
    Backgroundred    1.2461538 0.9900426 1.5715814
