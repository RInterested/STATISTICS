###EXACT MULTINOMIAL TEST (GOODNESS-OF-FIT):
<br>

It is the exact counterpart of the chi square goodness-of-fit (GoF) test, and extends the [binomial test](http://rinterested.github.io/statistics/sample_proportion_to_population.html) to multiple categories. So the binomial test would be a form of exact goodness-of-fit testing for one single proportion, while the multinomial test would deal with a categorical variable with multiple values or levels.

To calculate the [multinomial probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution) of a given distribution of counts given certain expected probabilities, the math is straightforward:


Suppose one does an experiment of extracting $n$ balls of k different colours from a bag, replacing the extracted ball after each draw. Balls from the same colour are equivalent. Denote the variable which is the number of extracted balls of colour $i$ ($i = 1,\cdots, k$) as $X_i$, and denote as $p_i$ the probability that a given extraction will be in color $i$.

$$f(x_1,\cdots\,x_k;\,n;\, p_1,\cdots,p_k) = \frac{n!}{x_1!\cdots x_k!}p_1^{x_1}\cdots p_k^{x_k}$$.

The computational problem comes about when trying to figure out all the possible permutations in the values of each level that would be even less probable than the values in the sample.

The test is in the `{ENT}` package, and the function is:

`multinomial.test(c(observed counts), c(expected probabilities)`

The number of permutation is called `events` and is calculated as ${n+k-1}\choose{k-1}$ where $k$ is the number of groups, and $n$ is the number of observations.

Looking into the function, if we want to check the probability that we observe proportions `A = 5, B = 2, C = 2` (low digits to make the rest of the demonstration easy) coming from a uniform distribution we'll call:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(EMT)
observed =c(A = 5, B = 2, C = 2)
prob =rep(1/length(observed),3)
out <- multinomial.test(observed, prob, useChisq = FALSE, MonteCarlo = FALSE)
```

This function calls on another function called `ExactMultinomialTest(observed, prob, size, groups, numEvents)` with the `size` calculated as `sum(observed)`, the `groups` as `length(observed)` - i.e. how many proportions -, and the `numEvents` as ${\text{size+groups-1}}\choose{\text{groups-1}}$:

```{r}
choose(9 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1)
```

What this function does is:

1. Calculates the multinomial probability (`pObs`) for the observed counts and probabilities: `dmultinom(observed, size, prob)`:

```{r}
(pObs = dmultinom(observed, size=9, prob))
```

2. Unfolds the permutations possible into a matrix through the operation...

```{r}
head(findVectors(groups=3, size=sum(observed)))
#Notice that each row equals the size, in this case, 9:
apply(head(findVectors(groups=3, size=sum(observed))),1, function(x) sum(x))
```

3. Then it calculates the exact multinomial probability for each one of these rows and selects the probabilities that are less than `pObs`. the sum of more unlikely events is the `p.value`:

```{r}
eventMat = findVectors(groups=3, size=sum(observed))
nrow(eventMat)
eventProb <- apply(eventMat, 1, function(x) dmultinom(x, 
        size = 9, prob = prob))
(p.value = sum(eventProb[eventProb <= pObs]))
```

The same calculation can be done using asymptotics as a chi-square GoF test:

```{r}
chisq.test(observed, p = prob, correct = F)
```

Not even close in this small sample...
