### METHOD OF MOMENTS:


The R implementation can be found in the [**gmm** package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmm/vignettes/gmm_with_R.pdf).

Once decided that a sample comes from a normal distribution, the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ can be estimated by either the method of moments or the generalized method of moments.

In the method of moments the two first moments of the population:

$\mathbb E[X]=\mu$ and $\mathbb E[(x-\mu)^2]= \sigma^2$ 

can be estimated with a system of two equations and two unknowns:

$\mathbb E[X-\hat\mu]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \hat \mu = \mu$

and

$\mathbb E[(X- \hat  \sigma)^2] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^2=\sigma^2$

However, more moments can be included in a weighted fashion:

The [third moment (skewness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) is:

$\mathbb E[(x-\mu)^3]$, which it is zero in the population.

This is estimated in the sample by $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^3=0.$

The [fourth moment (kurtosis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) is:

$\mathbb E[(x-\mu)^4]$, which is $3\sigma^4.$

This is estimated in the sample by $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^4 = 3\sigma^4.$


At this point we look at cost functions for each one of these moment estimators:

$\hat g_1=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i-\hat\mu$

$\hat g_2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^2-\sigma^2$

$\hat g_3=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^3$

$\hat g_4=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat\mu)^4-\sigma^2-3\sigma^4$

We place these estimated cost functions into a vector:

$\hat g=\begin{bmatrix}\hat g_1\\ \hat g_2\\ \hat q_3\\ \hat g_4\end{bmatrix}$

and we calculate the cost function:

$$\hat g\quad \begin{bmatrix}\text{WEIGHTS}\end{bmatrix}\quad\hat g$$
