###COUNTING WITH GENERATING FUNCTIONS:
<br>

From [this online post](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52268.html):

#####**Find the number of ordered partitions of $n$ into exactly $r$ parts ($r$ summands):**

$6$ can be partitioned into exactly $4$ **ordered** parts as 
follows:

  $$(3,1,1,1), (1,3,1,1), (1,1,3,1), (1,1,1,3), (2,2,1,1), (2,1,2,1)
  (2,1,1,2), (1,2,2,1), (1,2,1,2), (1,1,2,2).$$

We require the number of solutions of the following [Diophantine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation):

$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 6$$

The generating function is 

$$(x^1+x^2+x^3+x^4+\dots)^4$$

Why does it start at $x=x^1$, instead of at $1=x^0$, as [explained here](https://youtu.be/-drdeNMoe8w?list=PLDDGPdw7e6Aj0amDsYInT_8p6xTSTGEi2)? Because each $x^1 + x^2 + x^3 +x^4 + \dots$ is to be read as $(x^1)^1$ (i.e. $1$ number $1$); $(x^2)^1$ (i.e. $1$ number $2$); etc. There can't be a $1=x^0$ because it would leave an empty ($0$ contributing exponent) to whatever combination of, for example, 

$$(x^1 + x^{\color{red}{2}} + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 +\dots)(x^{\color{red}{1}} + x^2 + x^3+ x^4 + x^5 +\dots)(x^1 + x^2 + x^{\color{red}{3}} + x^4 + x^5+\dots)(x^1 + x^2 + x^3+ x^4 + x^{\color{red}{5}} +\dots)$$

which means $\color{red}{2 + 1 + 3 + 5} = 11.$ This doesn't add up to 6. It would rather be a way to getting to $11$ with $4$ parts. When multiplied, the different exponents are add to $11$: $x^{\color{red}{2}}x^{\color{red}{1}}x^{\color{red}{3}} x^{\color{red}{5}}=x^{\color{red}{11}}.$ Same for $x^{\color{red}{4}}x^{\color{red}{5}}x^{\color{red}{1}} x^{\color{red}{1}}=x^{\color{red}{11}}$. Hence, when all the $x^i$ in the $4$ polynomial series are multiplied, it will be the coefficient $\color{blue}{\bullet}x^{\color{red}{11}}$ that tells us that there are $\color{blue}{\bullet}$ ways of getting $4$-part partitions of $11$. Naturally, for $6$, we will have to unlock the coefficient for $x^{\color{red}{6}}.$

And how do we do that? This is nicely explained in [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZe281VxJVM), and requires turning the generating function into a form that contains the [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula). Since $x$'s are just placeholders, there is no issue with convergence (we can pretend that $x<1$), and apply the formula:

$$x^4[\color{green}{1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots}]^4$$

$$x^4\left[\color{green}{\frac{1}{1-x}}\right]^4=\frac{x^4}{(1-x)^4}$$

To find the coefficient of any generating function, we need to know that:

\begin{align}(1 + x + x^2 +\dots)^n&=\frac{1}{(1-x)^n}\\
&=1+\binom{1+n-1}{1}x+\binom{2+n-1}{2}x^2+\dots+\color{red}{\binom{r+n-1}{r}x^r}+\dots\tag{1}
\end{align}

Since we have the $x^4$ in front of the expansion of the geometric series, we will need to find, NOT the coefficient in front of $x^6$, BUT RATHER the coefficient in front of $x^{6-4}=x^2.$

The coefficient will be for $r=2$ and $n=4$ in Eq.1:

$$\binom{2+4-1}{2}=\binom{5}{2}=10$$

This is the general expression for the ordered partition of $n$ into EXACTLY $r$ parts.
