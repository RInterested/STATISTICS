###ONE SAMPLE TEST:

The one-sample z-test (or t-test) is used when we want to know whether our sample comes from a particular population but we do not have full population information available to us.

We test whether the population mean is bigger than a reference accepted value ($\mu_o$) based on the mean obtained from sample ($\bar X$).

We compare the sample mean, $\bar X$ to a constant $C$ so that the probability of a type I error is $\alpha$, which is typically $0.05$ or $5\%$:

<br>
$0.05 = p\,(\bar X \geq C) | \mu_o=30$
<br><br>
Normalizing:

<br>

$0.05\,=\,p(\frac{\bar X - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu_o=30)$
<br><br>

And the first part of the inequality is really the *Z-statistic*:

<br>

$0.05\,=\,p(Z\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu_o=30)$

<br><br>
For this to be true the second part of the inequality must be equal to:
<br>

$\Large \frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ `= qnorm(0.95)`


If $n$ is small we will do exactly the same thing but with a $t$ test:

$\Large \frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ `= qt(0.95, n - 1)`
