###TIME SERIES WITH VTI:
<br>

>The [Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA: VTI)](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122315/vti-vanguard-total-stock-market-etf.asp) tracks the performance of the [CRSP U.S. Total Market Index](http://www.crsp.com/products/investment-products/crsp-us-total-market-index). The fund has returned 6.23% since its inception in 2001. The fund is a market capitalization-weighted index that measures the entire investable U.S. equities market. It includes small-, mid- and large-cap companies. The fund is managed in a passive manner and uses an index-sampling strategy.


```{r, warning=F, message=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
library(quantmod)
VTI.raw = read.csv("VTI historical data.csv", header = T)
VTI.raw$Date <- as.Date(VTI.raw$Date)
rownames(VTI.raw) <- VTI.raw$Date
VTI = VTI.raw
VTI$Date <- NULL #to remove the column
VTI = as.xts(VTI)
chartSeries(VTI, type="auto", theme=chartTheme('white'))
```

Notice the [split of the shares](https://www.splithistory.com/vti/) reflected as the broad band on the left of the plot:

>Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has 1 split in our VTI split history database. The split for VTI took place on June 18, 2008. This was a 2 for 1 split, meaning for each share of VTI owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 2 shares.

#####How much can the VTI shares oscillate from day to day?

```{r}
z = as.data.frame(VTI$Adj.Close)    # Subsetting closing price

# Function to calculate % change in closing price between days:
D2D = function (x) {              
    days = nrow(x)
    delta = numeric(days)
    for(i in 2:days){
        delta[i] <- (100*((x[i,1] - x[i - 1,1])/(x[i - 1,1])))
    }
    delta
}
VTI$InterDay = D2D(z)               # Included as add'l column to VTI.
VTI.raw$InterDay = D2D(z)
head(VTI$InterDay)                  # A zero in entry 1 spells trouble...
#... we need something to fill in the 0 in row 1. Why not the mean?
VTI$InterDay[1]<-mean(VTI$InterDay) 

summary(VTI$InterDay)
```

So the maximum loss between days has been $-9.4\%$, and the maximum gain $12.8\%$. When did these events occur?

```{r}
VTI[VTI$InterDay == min(VTI$InterDay),]
VTI[VTI$InterDay == max(VTI$InterDay),]
```

... both during the financial crisis of 2008.

How often does a drop of say, $-4\%$ occurs?

```{r}
sum(VTI$InterDay < -4)
mean(VTI$InterDay < -4) * 100 # or 0.7% of the days
sum(VTI$InterDay < -4) / 16   # or between 1 and 2 days every year.
```

... and what about gains of $4\%$?

```{r}
sum(VTI$InterDay > 4)
mean(VTI$InterDay > 4) * 100 # or 0.6% of the days
sum(VTI$InterDay > 4) / 16   # or between 1 and 2 days every year.
```

But they can't be distributed uniformly... Let's first look at the losses...

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
at = VTI.raw$Date[format(VTI.raw$Date, '%m-%d') %in% c('01-05','01-07','01-07')]
plot(VTI.raw$Date, VTI.raw$InterDay < -4, pch=19, col=2, type='h', xaxt="n", xlab="Year", ylab="Days with > 4% loss", cex.axis=.5, cex.main=.8, cex.lab =.8, las=2, main  = "Clustering of big drop days")
axis(side=1, at=at, labels=format(at, '%y'), las=2, cex.axis=.7)
```

... and the wins...

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
at = VTI.raw$Date[format(VTI.raw$Date, '%m-%d') %in% c('01-05','01-07','01-07')]
plot(VTI.raw$Date, VTI.raw$InterDay > 4, pch=19, col=3, type='h', xaxt="n", xlab="Year", ylab="Days with > 4% gain", cex.axis=.5, cex.main=.8, cex.lab =.8, las=2, main  = "Clustering of big gain days")
axis(side=1, at=at, labels=format(at, '%y'), las=2, cex.axis=.7)
```

Finally, let's take a look at the fat tails of VTI as representative of the market, and as compared to the normal distribution:

```{r}
hist(VTI$InterDay,main="INTERDAY VTI % CHANGES: FAT TAILS",sub="fitted normal (in purple); pdf estimate (in blue)",xlab = "PERCENTAGE CHANGE FROM DAY TO DAY",
     ylab = "FREQUENCY", prob = TRUE, col ="coral", ylim=c(0,0.5),
     xlim=c(-4,4), cex.main=.9, cex.sub=.8, cex.lab=.7, border=F,
     breaks = 33)

#Add density estimate
lines(density(VTI$InterDay,adjust=7),col="darkred",lwd=2) #Prettier, adjusted pdf estimate
sd = sd(VTI$InterDay)
m = mean(VTI$InterDay)
curve(dnorm(x,mean=m,sd=sd),col="grey60",lwd=2,add=T,yaxt="n")
lines(density(VTI$InterDay,adjust=7),col="darkred",lwd=2) #Prettier, adjusted pdf estimate

```
