###MANN-WHITNEY U TEST or WILCOXON RANK-SUM TEST (WRS):
<br>

From [this question on CV](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/26817/67822):

Comparing two vectors of data without assuming a normal distribution:

```{r}
x <- scan(text="8 8 4 1 2 2 0 2 5 2 3 3 3 1 5 4 4 1 4 2") 
y <- scan(text="4 0 4 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1")
```

can be done with a permutation test, which will give us the one-sided $p$-value:

```{r}
set.seed(0)
xy <- c(x, y)                                        # Combo vec. with x and y combined. 40 entries.
sample <- replicate(1e5, sum(sample(xy, length(x)))) # 1e5 samples of length(x) w/o replac. from combo xy, returning the sum of their elements.
mean_x_samples <- sample / length(x)                 # 1e5 means from length(x) samples from xy
diff <- sum(xy) - sample                             # Difference between combo vec and samples
mean_y_samples <- diff / length(y)                   # 1e5 means from length(y) samples from xy
delta_samples <- mean_x_samples - mean_y_samples
stat <- mean(x) - mean(y)
(p_value = mean(delta_samples > stat))
```

In R we can get a two-tailed $p$ value with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
wilcox.test(x, y, paired=F) 

# If both x and y are given and paired is FALSE, a Wilcoxon rank sum test 
# (equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test: see the Note) is carried out. 
```
