###OLS DIAGNOSTICS - Df Betas:
<br>

This was an [original question posted in CV](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/141243/67822).


I am trying to replicate what the function `dfbetas()` does in ***R***.

`dfbeta()` is not an issue... Here is a set of vectors:

    x <- c(0.512, 0.166, -0.142, -0.614, 12.72)
    y <- c(0.545, -0.02, -0.137, -0.751, 1.344)
   
If I fit two regression models as follows:

    fit1 <- lm(y ~ x)
    fit2 <- lm(y[-5] ~ x[-5])

I see that eliminating the last point results in a very different slope (blue line - steeper):

This is reflected in the change in slopes:

    fit1$coeff[2] - fit2$coeff[2]
    -0.9754245

which coincides with the `dfbeta(fit1)` for the fifth value.

Now if I want to standardize this change in slope (obtain ***dfbetas***) and I resort to: 

> Williams, D. A. (1987) Generalized linear model diagnostics using the
> deviance and single case deletions. Applied Statistics 36, 181â€“191

which I think may be one of the references in the R documentation under the package **{stats}**. There the formula for ***dfbetas*** is:

$\large dfbetas (i,fit) = \Large {(\hat{b} - \hat{b_{-i}})\over SE\, \hat{b_{-i}}}$

This could be easily calculated in R:

    (fit1$coef[2] - fit2$coef[2])/summary(fit2)$coef[4]

yielding: `-6.79799` 

The question is why I am not getting the fifth value for the slope in:

    dfbetas(fit1)
    
      (Intercept)            x
    1  1.06199661  -0.39123009
    2  0.06925319  -0.02907481
    3 -0.02165967   0.01003539
    4 -1.24491242   0.65495527
    5 -0.54223793 -93.81415653!

What is the right equation to go from ***dfbeta*** to ***dfbetas***?

And this is the [answer in CV](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/141246/67822):

$DFBETAS_{k(i)}$ is calculated by:

$\Large \frac{b_k-b_{k(i)}}{\sqrt{MSE_{(i)}c_{kk}}}$, for $k$ = 1, 2, . . . , $p$. $p$ is the number of regression parameters or coefficients.

where $b_k$ is the $k$th regression coefficient that uses all the data and $b_{k(i)}$ is the same coefficient with the $i$th case deleted.  $MSE_{(i)}$ here is the mean-square error from the regression where the $i$ case is deleted and $c_{kk}$ is the $k$th diagonal element of the unscaled covariance matrix $(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}$.  

So you can calculate $DFBETAS_{k(i)}$ manually with the following R code:

    numerator<-(fit1$coef[2] - fit2$coef[2])
    denominator<-sqrt((summary(fit2)$sigma^2)*diag(summary(fit1)$cov.unscaled)[2])
    DFBETAS<-numerator/denominator
    DFBETAS
            x 
    93.81416
