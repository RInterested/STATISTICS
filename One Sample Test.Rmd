To test whether the population mean is bigger than a reference accepted value based on a sample.

We compare the sample mean, $\bar X$ to a constant $C$ so that the probability of a type I error is $\alpha$, which is typically $0.05$ or $5\%$.

So $\Large 0.05 = p\,(\bar X \geq C) | \mu_o=30$
<br><br>
$\Large p(\frac{\bar X - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=30)$
<br><br>
$\Large p(Z\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=30)$

<br>

$\Large \frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ `= pnorm(0.95)`
