###FISHER INFORMATION MATRICES:
<br>

In general, the likelihood function describes the probability of getting a value (or set of values) given another value or set of values. That is, it's the probability of getting a set of data (which will be measured) given an underlying theory by which the universe or what you are measuring can be described:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \equiv \Pr[\text{data | theory}]
\end{equation}
\noindent Below are three examples of likelihood functions (see figure \ref{likeli_graph} below)--the distribution of probabilities that a particular parameter (here $\lambda$) will describe your data. The narrowness of the curve corresponds to how well you will be able to constrain your data. The center value of the very narrow curve is the true value of the parameter--the value at which you are very likely to measure your data set--and the probability of getting your set of measured data falls off as you move away from this true value. Thus, if the value of $\lambda$ is equal to this center value, we are far more likely to see the data we measure.
