### Tensors linearize multi-linear functions:

---

Tensors are not multi-dimensional arrays. Further, the representation of a tensor as a matrix in the most simple examples is also misleading. Why? Because the idea of a tensor is to linearlize a multi-linear function.

For instance, a bilinear function (like any other multi-linear functions) is not linear. Take for example the area of a rectangle $A = s \times l$: Doubling the side of a rectangle, doubles the area, and the same happens with the length; however, the function is bilinear, such that doubling the side and the lenght result in an area of the rectangle $4$ times larger. The dot product is such another example: the total cost of some purchases is the dot product of the number of units of each item purchased by the cost of each unit. A dubling of the price of each item, and a concomitant doubling of the number of units purchased of each item will increase four-fold the overall 


```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

The dot product fulfills the criteria for a [bi-variate function](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Dot_Product_Operator_is_Bilinear), which amount to being linear on the left:

$$\langle au + bv, w \rangle = a \langle u, w \rangle + b \langle v, w \rangle$$

and on the right:

$$\langle u, av + bw \rangle = a \langle u, v \rangle + b \langle u, w \rangle.$$

```{r}
u = 1:3
v = 4:6
w = 7:9
a = 5
b = 8

(a * u + b * v) %*% w
a * (u %*% w) + b * (v %*% w)

u %*% (a * v + b * w)
a * (u %*% v) + b * (u %*% w)

(a * v) %*% (a * w)
a^2 * (v %*% w)

```{r}
m = matrix(c(rnorm(30)), 6, byrow=T)
m
M = rbind(m[c(1:3),], 5 * m[4,] + m[5,], m[6,])
M
det(M)
5 * det(m[c(1:4,6),]) + det(m[c(1:3,5:6),])
