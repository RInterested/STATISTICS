###PLOTTING IN THE COMPLEX PLANE:
<br>

The code in R can be found [here](https://github.com/RInterested/PLOTS/blob/master/EULER'S%20EQUATION).

The $x$ coordinate is the real part, and the $y$ coordinate, the imaginary part.

Translation can be achieved by adding a complex number to every point. Scaling is done by multiplying by a scalar.

Inverting is accomplished simply multiplying by the scalar $-1$, and the way to picture it is by realizding that the $-1$ changes the the sign of the real and imaginary components.

To rotate $90$ degrees we multiply by $i$:

$i \times (x + y*i) = -y +x*i.$

Rotating by another angle requires some background:

*Argument of a complex angle*: angle between the vectorial representation of the complex number and $1 + 0i.$ This correponds to the angle, measured in radians, between the x axis and the arrow representing the complex number.

Euler's formula codes every point in the unit circle as:

$\Large e^{\theta\,i}$ with $\large \theta$ being the argument.

 The trick is to divide the circle $2\,\pi$ into an arbritary number of equally spaced points, for instance, $200$: $2\,\pi/200$. In this way, every point can be rotated a given amount of these divisions of the circle (e.g. $n$) as follows:
 
 $\Huge e^{\,\huge i\times\,n \,\times \frac{2\pi}{200}}= \Large cos(n \,\times \frac{2\pi}{200}) + i\,sin(n \,\times \frac{2\pi}{200}).$
