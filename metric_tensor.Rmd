###THE METRIC TENSOR:
<br>

The length or magnitud of the vector $dS$ is given by:

$$dS^2=\left(dX^1\right)^2 + \left(dX^2\right)^2 + \left(dX^3\right)^2 + \cdots = \large \delta_{mn} \;\color{blue}{dX^m}\, dX^n\tag 1$$

Notice that the dummy indexes are set up to sum over. We start with $m=1$, and we see that all terms are going to be zero unless when $n=1$, in which case it will be $dX^1\, dX^1 = (dX^1)^2.$

But how to write the same for the curvilinear system?

We have to refer back to the following expression at the beginning of the [notes on tensors](http://rinterested.github.io/statistics/tensors.html):

$$dy^n = \frac{\partial y^n}{\partial x^\color{blue}{m}} dx^{\color{blue}{m}} \tag{Einstein's convention}$$

In this case we have that the part in blue in Eq. 1 can be expressed as:

$$\color{blue}{dX^m}= \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial y^r} dy^r.$$

Hence, Eq. 1 becomes,

$$dS^2 = \large \delta_{mn} \;dX^m\, dX^n= \large \underset{\text{METRIC TENSOR }\Large g^{(y)}_{\color{red}{rs}}}{\underbrace{\delta_{mn}\frac{\partial x^m}{\partial y^\color{red}{r}}\frac{\partial x^n}{\partial y^\color{red}{s}}}} \;dy^r\; dy^s$$

We write,

$$dS^2 = q^{(y)}_{rs}\,dy^r\,dy^s$$

If we were operating with both systems being curvilinear, the measure of the vector wouldn't be as simple in the $X$ system as before. We would have:

$$\large g^{(x)}_{mn}\,dx^m\,dx^n=g^{(y)}_{rs}\,dy^r\,dy^s$$
