### Conditional Logistic Regression:

From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbMIrO3HsFA&ab_channel=JuliaWrobel):

Matching is a way of controlling for confounding and bias, as well as increasing precision. Subjects are paired or grouped based on pre-specified characteristics. In matched case-control studies, each patient is matched by one or more subjects without the disease, matched of covariates of interest (age, gender, ethnicity).

Matching variables are not included in the model as covariates. Including them, leads to extreme bias in the odds-ratio estimates. It will be approximately the squared value of the true odds-ratio.

The notation is (from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5MkpIKHtg&t=26s&ab_channel=JuliaWrobel))

The probability that the $i$-th person in the $k$-th matched set has disease is:

$$P_{k}({\bf X}_{ik})$$

where $k$ is the strata (matched groups $k \in \{1,2,\dots, K\}$), and $i$ is the individual $i\in \{0,1,\dots,M+1\}$ with $i=0$ being the case, and $i=1,\dots, M$ the matched controls in a $1:M$ case-control study. ${\bf X}_{ik}= X_{ik_1}, X_{ik_2},\dots,X_{ik_p}$ is the vector of covariates of interest for the $i$-th person in the $k$-th matched set.

The model is

$$\text{logit}\left(P_k(X_{ik})\right)=\log\frac{P_k(X_{ik})}{1 - P_k(X_{ik})}=\alpha_k + \beta_1 \,X_{ik_1}+\dots+\beta_p \,X_{ik_p}$$

The odds that a subject with $x = 1$ is a case equals $\exp(\beta)$ times the odds that a subject with $x = 0$ is a case in the simple case $\text{logit}(P(\text{case}))=\alpha + \beta\,x.$

Each matched set has a different intercept, summarizing the effect of the matching variables on the probability of disease.

And $\beta_p$ is the $\log\text{OR}$ of disease of those exposed to covariate $p$ to those not exposed to it.

The problem with the model above is that the number of parameters increases at the same rate as the sample size with the consequence that maximum likelihood estimation is no longer viable. We can overcome this problem if we regard the parameters $\alpha_i$ as of little interest and so are willing to forgo
their estimation. If we do, we can then create a conditional likelihood function
that will yield maximum likelihood estimators of the coefficients, $β_1, \dots , β_q,$ that are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.

The joint probability that the vector of covariates ${\bf X}_{0k}$ corresponds to the case, and ${\bf X}_{ik}$ with $i\in \{1,\dots, M\}$ to the controls is

$$P(X_{0k}\mid Y=1 \;\cap\; X_{1,2,\dots,M} \mid Y=0) = P({\bf X}_{0k} \mid Y=1)\;\; \prod_{i=1}^M\,P({\bf X}_{ik} \mid Y=0)$$

because we assume that the covariate vectors are independent of each other.

To construct the conditional likelihood that one of the $M+1$ subjects in the $k$-th matched set is the case and the remainder are the controls:

$$\begin{align}
&P({\bf X}_{0k}\mid Y=1) \prod_{i=1}^M P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=0) + 
P({\bf X}_{1k}\mid Y=1) \prod_{i\neq 1} P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=0)+
P({\bf X}_{Mk}\mid Y=1) \prod_{i\neq M} P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=0)\\[2ex]
&=\sum_{l=0}^MP({\bf X}_{lk}\mid Y=1) \prod_{r \neq l}^M P({\bf X}_{rk}\mid Y=0)
\end{align}
$$

The conditional likelihood of interest is

$$L_k = \frac{P({\bf X}_{0k}\mid Y=1) \quad\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^M P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=0)}{\sum_{l=0}^MP({\bf X}_{lk}\mid Y=1)\quad \displaystyle \prod_{r \neq l}^M P({\bf X}_{rk}\mid Y=0)}$$
Utilizing Bayes' theorem, $\small P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=1)=\frac{P(Y=1\mid {\bf X}_{ik})\,P({\bf X}_{ik})}{P(Y=1)}$ and $\small P({\bf X}_{ik}\mid Y=0)=\frac{P(Y=0\mid {\bf X}_{ik})\,P({\bf X}_{ik})}{P(Y=0)}$:

$$L_k =\displaystyle \frac{\frac{P(Y=1\mid {\bf X}_{0k})\,P({\bf X}_{0k})}{P(Y=1)} \quad\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^M \frac{P(Y=0\mid {\bf X}_{ik})\,P({\bf X}_{ik})}{P(Y=0)}}{\displaystyle\sum_{l=0}^M\frac{P(Y=1\mid {\bf X}_{lk})\,P({\bf X}_{lk})}{P(Y=1)} \quad\displaystyle\prod_{r \neq l}^M \frac{P(Y=0\mid {\bf X}_{rk})\,P({\bf X}_{rk})}{P(Y=0)}}$$

The factor $\frac{\prod_i^M P({\bf X}_{ik})}{P(Y=1)P(Y=0)^M}$ appears both in the numerator and denominator and will cancel out, yielding

$$L_k =\frac{P(Y=1\mid {\bf X}_{0k})\,P({\bf X}_{0k})\quad \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^M P(Y=0\mid {\bf X}_{ik})}{\displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^M P(Y=1\mid {\bf X}_{lk})\,P({\bf X}_{lk}) \quad \displaystyle\prod_{r \neq l}^M P(Y=0\mid {\bf X}_{rk})}\tag 1$$

Now, for the $i$-th person in the $k$-th stratum,

$$\text{logit}\,P(Y_i = 1 \mid {\bf X}_{ik}) =\alpha_k + \beta_1 X_{ik_1}+\dots + \beta_p X_{ik_p}$$

or 

$$P(Y_i=1\mid {\bf X}_{ik}) = \frac{e^{\alpha_k + {\bf X}_{ik}{\bf \beta}}}{1 + e^{\alpha_k + {\bf X}_{ik}{\bf \beta}}} $$

and

$$P(Y_i=0\mid {\bf X}_{ik}) =1 - P(Y_1 =1\mid {\bf X}_{ik})= \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha_k + {\bf X}_{ik}{\bf \beta}}} $$
Substituting into Eq $(1),$

$$L_k(\beta) = \frac{e^{\alpha_k + {\bf X}_{ik}{\bf \beta}}}{\sum_{l=0}^M e^{\alpha_k + {\bf X}_{ikl}{\bf \beta}}}$$

Now $e^{\alpha_k}$ can be pulled out from both numerator and denominator:

$$L_k(\beta) = \frac{e^{ {\bf X}_{ik}{\bf \beta}}}{\sum_{l=0}^M e^{ {\bf X}_{ikl}{\bf \beta}}}$$

After the derivation of the log likelihood, the intercepts will cancel: Since the intercepts can't be estimated the probability of disease per strata cannot be estimated either. However, the $\log{\text{ODDS}}$ is independent of the intercepts and can be estimated.


The overall likelihood is the product of likelihood for each stratum:

$$L(\beta)= \prod_{k=1}^K L_k(\beta)$$

> The estimate of the odds ratio of a herniated disc occurring in a driver
relative to a nondriver is $1.93$ with a $95\%$ confidence interval of $(1.09, 3.44).$ Conditional on residence we can say that the risk of a herniated disc occurring in a driver is about twice that of a nondriver. There is no evidence that where a person lives affects the risk of lower back pain.

From [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5840200/):

Matching on demographic variables is commonly used in case–control studies to adjust for confounding at the design stage. There is a presumption that matched data need to be analyzed by matched methods. Conditional logistic regression has become a standard for matched case–control data to tackle the sparse data problem. 

From [here](https://www.usu.edu/math/jrstevens/biostat/projects2013/rep_CondlLogReg.pdf):

In matched case control studies each case is matched with a control subject based on variables that could affect the response but is not necessarily of interest to the research. Factors such as age, gender, race etc. are taken into consideration when matching. Because matching is subject specific each case-control pair potentially has a different probability of
risk. Performing a logistic regression analysis on this would result in needing dummy variables for each pair! Doing so results in too many fixed effects to estimate with respect to the sample size and leads to biased estimates. 

From [here](https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~otava/ClinExpSolution/assignment3_solution.html). The matching algorithm in R is [here](https://sejdemyr.github.io/r-tutorials/statistics/tutorial8.html).

The Los Angeles Study of Endometrial Cancer was a matched case-control study conducted in California in the 1970’s. There are 63 cases of endometrial cancer, all women age 55 or over, each matched to four controls living in the same retirement community. The primary exposure of interest was estrogen use. The secondary exposure was gallbladder disease. The Epi library in R includes two versions of the data: the full dataset `bdendo` and a subset containing a single control matched to each case `bdendo11`.

```

From the package `survival` the function `clogit()`:

```{r}
fit <- clogit(d ~ est + strata(set), data = bdendo11)
summary(fit)
extractAIC(fit)[2]
```

From the package `Epi` the function `clogistic()`:

```{r}
fit2 <- clogistic(d ~ est, strata = set, data = bdendo11)
fit2
```

From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYY5dfA-xc&ab_channel=JuliaWrobel):

Cases (`case`) are women with secondary infertility (`1`). `spontaneous` and `induced` are abortions. The cases are matched to controls based on `education`, `age` and `parity`. There are two controls per case:

```{r}
data("infert")
infert[infert$pooled.stratum==2,]
```

We could ignore the matching factors altogether:


```{r}
regLG <- glm(case ~ induced + spontaneous, data=infert, family='binomial')
summary(regLG)$coef
```

Or treat matching factors as covariates:

```{r}
adjregLG <- glm(case ~ induced + spontaneous + age + education + parity, data=infert, family='binomial')
summary(adjregLG)$coef
```

However, this can lead to bias in the coefficients, as can bee seen in the different outputs above. Without adjustment, for instance, only `spontaneous` abortion is significant.

Using conditional logistic regression:

```{r}
condLG <- clogit(case ~ induced + spontaneous + strata(pooled.stratum), data=infert)
summary(condLG)$coef
```

The values are closer to the adjusted coefficients.

Another example from [here](https://people.stat.sc.edu/hoyen/STAT705/Notes/Lecture12.pdf):

```{r}
data(VC1to6)
fitclogit<-clogit(case ~ smoking + rubber + alcohol + strata(matset), data=VC1to6)
summary(fitclogit)
```
