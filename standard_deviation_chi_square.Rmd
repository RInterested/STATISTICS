### CHI SQUARE TEST FOR THE VARIANCE OR STANDARD DEVIATION:


Assuming that the data are normally distributed, the chi-square test can be used for the variance or standard deviation: Is the population variance or standard deviation is equal to a specified value?

The test statistic is:

$$\chi^2_{\text{stat}} = \frac{(n-1)\,S^2}{\sigma^2}$$

where

$n = \text{sample size}$
$S^2 = \text{sample variance}$
$\sigma^2 = \text{hypothetical population variance}$

We want to know if the standard deviation has changed from a hypthetical
$5$ mL in a bottling soda company Thus, you use a two-tail test with the following null and alternative hypotheses:

$H_0: \sigma^2 = 25$ ($\sigma = 5$ mL)
$H_1: \sigma^2 \neq 25$.

With a sample of 30 bottles, you reject the null hypothesis if the computed test statistic falls into either the lower or upper tail of a chi-square distribution with $n-1 = 30 - 1 =29$ degrees of freedom,

If the sample standard deviation is $S = 8$ mL, the test statistic would be:

$\chi^2 = \frac{(30-1)\,(8)^2}{5^2}=74.24$

The theshold values with a risk alpha of $0.05$ are:

```{r}
qchisq(c(0.025, 1 - 0.025), 29)
```

Hence we reject $H_0$, in favor of the alternative hypthesis that the variance has increased with a p value of:

```{r}
(p = 1 - pchisq(74.24, 29))
```
