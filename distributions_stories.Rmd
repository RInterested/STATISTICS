###POISSON:
<br>

In probability theory, a Poisson process is a stochastic process that counts the number of events and the time points at which these events occur in a given time interval. The time between each pair of consecutive events has an **exponential distribution** with parameter $\lambda$ and each of these inter-arrival times is assumed to be independent of other inter-arrival times. The process is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson and is a good model of radioactive decay, telephone calls and requests for a particular document on a web server among many other phenomena.

The Poisson process is a continuous-time process; the sum of a Bernoulli process can be thought of as its discrete-time counterpart. A Poisson process is a pure-birth process, the simplest example of a birth-death process. It is also a point process on the real half-line.

Probability of getting $5$ e-mails (n Poisson events) in $1$ day, given an average rate. Mnemonic: Probability of getting $n$ fishes - “poissons” in French.


###EXPONENTIAL:
<br>

Probability of having to wait $1$ hour before the next e-mail arrives (Poisson event). Parameter: 

Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is the continuous analogue of the **geometric distribution** (number of Bernoulli trials before getting the first success, e.g. Heads), and it has the key property of being memoryless.

###GAMMA:
<br>

Probability of having to wait $1$ day to get $5$ e-mails (time to $n$-th Poisson event). We add inter-arrival times (exponential lambda). This fact: that the gamma distribution represents the sum of exponential distributions (convolution) is proved by deriving the mgf of the gamma. 

Parameters: $n$ ($a$ or $K$ or $\alpha$) (shape) and $\lambda$ (or $\beta$ or $1/\theta$) (scale). It’s the continuous analogue of the **negative binomial** (i.e. sum of geometric) = number of Bernoulli trials before reaching n successes (eg. $4$ heads).
