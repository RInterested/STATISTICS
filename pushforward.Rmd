### The pushforward:

---

#### Introduction and Motivation:

The motivation behind this post is to understand the idea of left invariant vector fields (homogeneous) as the pushforward $L_{*g} X$ of a vector field $X$ (section of the tangent bundle) - the thick arrows in the diagram - on the tangent space at a point $h$ to the point $gh$ resulting from left-sided multiplication in the Lie group by a chosen element $g$. The pushforward would move the vector $\color{red}{\vec v}$ in the left-variant vector field at $h$ to the vector $\color{red}{L_{*g}\vec v}$ and coincide with the original vector at $gh$, i.e. $\color{blue}{\vec w_{gh}}$:

Each vector in the tangent space at the identity generates a left invariant vector field by virtue of the pushforward. The set of these left invariant vector fields is finite dimensional, and isomorphic to the tangent space at the identity, underpinning the exponential map, which allows reconstructing the group from the tangent space at the identity through the exponential map, as in this simple example of the circle, which also illustrates a left invariant vector field on the manifold (the circle $S^1$):

The vector field (blue arrows at each point) is generated by the pushforward of the tangent vector at the identity of the parameterized imaginary line as it is operated on by the group addition (on the imaginary line).  This parameterized line is $\sigma(\theta)=i\theta\; \theta \in \mathbb R$ (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)#Examples)). The points in this vertical line along the imaginary axis are mapped to the circle by $\phi(\theta)=e^{i\theta}.$ The tangent vector to this parameterized line at $\theta=0$ is $X_{\theta=0}=\frac d{d\theta}(i \theta)= 1i=\partial_\theta.$  The pushforward of this vector at $\theta =0$ on the tangent to the circle is hence $$\left.\partial_\theta(\phi)\right|_{\theta=0}=\left.\frac d{d\theta}\,e^{i\,\theta}\right|_{\theta=0}=\left. ie^{i\theta}\right|_{\theta=0}=\left. -\sin\theta +i\cos \theta\right|_{\theta=0}=\color{red}i$$ 

In this case the coordinates do not change from the manifold represented by the straightline along the imaginary axis to the circle $S^1,$ where this $i$ vector lives (tangent to the circle). 

The entire vector field can be generated by pushing forward the vectors tangent to the point $\theta=0$ along the imaginary line, resulting from the group operation of addition on the group $(i\mathbb R, +)$ on this $1i$ element at the identity as follows $Y_{\phi(p)}=\phi_*(X_p)=\left( 1\, \partial _\theta\right)\, \left( e^{i\theta}\right)=-\sin\theta +i\cos \theta=\color{blue}{i e^{i\theta}}.$

From [page 58 of An Introduction to Differential Geometry through Computation by Mark E. Fels](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=oer_textbooks):

Let $\phi: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$ be a $C^\infty$ function and let $p \in \mathbb R^n$. The function $\phi$ can be used to define a function

$$\phi_{∗,p} : T_p \mathbb R^n \to T_{\phi(p)}\mathbb R^m$$

The map  is $\phi_{*,p}$ called **the pushforward**, the differential, or the Jacobian of $\phi$ at the point $p.$

 
The **pushforward** of the tangent vector to a curve $\sigma$ at $p = \sigma(t_0)$
is the tangent vector of the image curve $\phi(\sigma)$ at $q = \phi(\sigma(t_0)).$ That is,

$$\phi_{∗,p}\;\dot\sigma(t_0) = \phi_{∗,p}\;X_p =\left. \left ( \frac{d}{dt}\, \phi \; \circ \; \sigma \right)  \right|_{t=t_0}$$ 

For the tangent vector $X_p = \dot \sigma (t_0)$ where $p = \sigma(t_0).$ In coordinates:

$$ X_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \left. \frac{d\,\sigma^i}{dt} \right|_{t=t_0} \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$$



For the curve $\phi(\sigma(t)),$ let $Y_q$ be the tangent vector at $q = \phi(\sigma(t_0))$ which is


$$\begin{align}
Y_q  &= \sum_{i=1}^n \left. \frac{d\,\phi^i\left(\sigma(t)\right)}{dt} \right|_{t=t_0} \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\right|_q \\[3ex]
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \; \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \left. \frac{\partial\,\phi^i}{\partial x^j} \right|_p \left. \frac{d\sigma^j}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0} \right) \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\right|_q
\end{align}$$


where $(y^i)_{1≤i≤n}$ denotes the coordinates on the image space of $\phi.$

#### Example

Let $\phi: \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^3$ (no manifold is more homeomorphic to Euclidean space than that!) is given by

$$\phi(x,y) = \left(u=x^2 + y^2, v= x^2 - y^2, w =xy  \right)$$

and the curve $\sigma: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^2$:


$$\sigma(t) = (1 + 3t , 2 - 2t)$$

which at $t=0$ corresponds to 

$$\sigma(0) = (1,2).$$

The derivative is

$$\dot \sigma(t)=(3,-2)$$

which doesn't have any dependency on $t,$ and therefore the tangent vector at $t=0$ is directly given by

$$\left(\dot \sigma(0)\right)_{\sigma(0)}=(3, -2)_{(1,2)}$$

The image curve $\phi \circ \sigma: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^3:$


$$\phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)= \left( (1+3t)^2+(2-2t)^2,\quad (1+3t)^2-(2-2t)^2,\quad (1+3t)(2-2t) \right)$$

and the point mapped from $\sigma(0)=(1,2)$ to $\mathbb R^3$ by $\phi$ is

$$\left. \phi\left(\sigma(t) \right) \right|_{t=0}=(5,-3,2)$$

The tangent vector to the image curve $\phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)$ is [derived](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=Divide%5Bd%2Cdt%5D%5C%2840%29Power%5B%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D+%2B+Power%5B%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D%5C%2844%29Power%5B%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D+%E2%88%92+Power%5B%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D%5C%2844%29%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%5C%2841%29) as

$$\frac d{dt} \phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)=\left(26t - 2, \quad 10t +14,\quad -12t +4  \right)$$

when $t=0$ is


$$\left(\left. \frac{d}{dt} \phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)\right|_{t=0}  \right)_{\phi\left( \sigma(0)\right)} = (-2, 14, 4)_{(5,-3,2)}$$


The map $\phi_{∗,p}$ has the property that if $(\dot σ(t_0))_{σ(t_0)}$
is the tangent vector to the curve $σ$ at $p = σ(t_0)$ with corresponding derivation $X_p$, then $Y_q = \phi_{∗,p}\,X_p$ is the derivation $Y_q$ corresponding to
the tangent vector $\phi \circ \sigma$ at the image point $\phi(p) = \phi(σ(t0)).$ In the example this means $p = (1, 2)$ and $X_p = (3\partial x − 2 \partial y)_{(1,2)}$, and
$Y_q = (−2 \partial u + 14 \partial v + 4 \partial w)_{(5,−3,2)} = \theta_{∗,p}X_p$.

Summary:

When $t=0,$ $p=\sigma (0)=(1,2),$ a point in $\mathbb R^2$ which is mapped to $\phi \left( \sigma(0) \right)=(5, -3,2).$

The tangent to the curve $\sigma$ at $t=0$ is $\dot\sigma(0)=(3,-2).$ Now, this vector can be **pushed forward** from $(1,2)$ to $(5,-3,1)$ via the **pushforward $\phi_{*,p}$**, which is

$$\bbox[magenta,15px,border:0.5px solid black]{\color{white}{\phi_{*,p}=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\phi(\sigma(t))\right|_{t=0}}}$$

The operation whereby the vector $(3,-2)$ is sent to $\mathbb R^3$ is denoted $\phi_{∗,p}\,X_p.$

This results can also be obtained as in page 62 of the linked document by considering that the pushed forward of the vector above, defined  at $p=\sigma(t=0)=(1,2),$ and labelled $X_p=\dot \sigma(t=0)=(3,-2)$ is $X_p =\left. (3\,\partial_x-2\,\partial_y)\right|_{p},$ and having this vector (remember vector bases in differential geometry are simply differential operators) act on the different coordinates of the map $\phi$ as in:

$$\begin{align}
\phi_{*,p}(X_p)(u) &= \underset{\small\text{derivative operator}\color{orange}{\Huge \rightarrow}}{\underbrace{(3\,\partial_x-2\,\partial_y)_{(1,2)}}}\quad\underset{\phi_u}{\underbrace{(x^2+y^2)}}=\left. 3 \partial_x\,(x^2) - 2 \partial_y\,(y^2)=3(2x)-2(2y)\right|_{(1,2)}   =6-8=-2\\[2ex]
\phi_{*,p}(X_p)(v) &= \underset{\small\text{derivative operator}\color{orange}{\Huge \rightarrow}}{\underbrace{(3\,\partial_x-2\,\partial_y)_{(1,2)}}}\quad\underset{\phi_v}{\underbrace{(x^2-y^2)}}=3\partial_x\,(x^2)-2\partial_y\,(-y^2)=\left. 3(2x) + 2(2y) \right|_{(1,2)} =6+8=14\\[2ex]
\phi_{*,p}(X_p)(w) &= \underset{\small\text{derivative operator}\color{orange}{\Huge \rightarrow}}{\underbrace{(3\,\partial_x-2\,\partial_y)_{(1,2)}}}\quad\underset{\phi_w}{\underbrace{(xy)}}=3\partial_x\,(xy) -2\partial_y\,(xy)=\left. 3(y)-2(x)\right|_{(1,2)}=6-2=4\\[2ex]
\end{align}
$$

or 

$$\phi_{*,p}(X_p)=(-2\partial_u+ 14\partial_v+ 4\partial_w).$$

Or calculating the Jacobian matrix at $(1,2)$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial\phi^a}{\partial x^i}
\end{bmatrix}_{(1,2)}
=\begin{bmatrix}
2x & 2y\\
2x & -2y\\
y & x
\end{bmatrix}_{(1,2)}=
\begin{bmatrix}
2&4\\2&-4\\2&1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

which multiplied times the $X_p=(3,-2),$

$$\begin{bmatrix}
2&4\\2&-4\\2&1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
3\\-2
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
-2\\14\\4
\end{bmatrix}$$

This last expression is a clear illustration of the linear transformation from one tangent space to another: the tangent vector $(3,-2)$ at the point $(1,2)$ is sent via matrix multiplication to $(-2, 14,4).$

### The pullback:

---

From page 115 of the reference above, let's again begin with a function between two and three dimensional Euclidean space: $\phi: \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^3,$ this time given by

$$\phi(x,y) = \left(u=x + y, v= x^2 - y^2, w =xy  \right)$$
Let a one form at a point $q= \phi(1,2)=(3,-3,2)$ in the target manifold (i.e. $\mathbb R^3$) be $\tau_q$:

$$\tau_q = (2\,du - 3\,dv+ dw)_q$$

The pullback is calculated much like for the calculations of the pushforward above as sending the covector given in $\mathbb R^3$ to $\mathbb R^2$ by applying the exterior derivative to the function $\phi$ componentwise first:

$$\begin{align}
\phi^*_q\; du_q &=  \underset{\small\text{d exterior derivative}}{\underbrace{d(x+y)_{(1,2)}}}=(dx + dy)_{(1,2)}\\[2ex]
\phi^*_q\; dv_q &=  \underset{\small\text{d exterior derivative}}{\underbrace{d(x^2-y^2)_{(1,2)}}}=(2x\,dx -2y\,dy)_{(1,2)}=(2\,dx - 4\,dy)_{(1,2)}\\[2ex]
\phi^*_q\; dw_q &=  \underset{\small\text{d exterior derivative}}{\underbrace{d(xy)_{(1,2)}}}=(2\,dx + dy)_{(1,2)}\\[2ex]
\end{align}
$$

and then feeding the coefficients of the form $\tau_q$:

$$\begin{align}
\left. \phi^*_q\; (2\,du -3 \,dv + dw) \right|_q&=  2\,\phi^*_q(\left. du \right|_q) -3 \,\phi^*_q(\left. dv \right|_q) + \phi^*_q(\left. dw \right|_q)\\[2ex]
&= 2(dx+dy) - 3 (2\,dx - 4\,dy) + (2\,dx + dy)\\[2ex]
&= (-2\,dx + 15 \,dy)_{(1,2)}
\end{align}
$$

So the differential form $\tau_q$ is specified in $\mathbb R^3,$ which is the *image space* of $\phi$. For every point in the *domain* of $\phi$, i.e. $p \in \mathbb R^2$ we can define the **pullback**  as the *differential form* $\alpha_p$ corresponding to the exterior derivative as performed above: componentwise and using the $\phi$ function. This is to say: $\alpha_p = \phi^*_q(\tau_{\phi(p)}).$ The pullback is the map back to $\mathbb R^2$ of the differential form $\tau,$ or $\alpha=\phi^*\tau.$ 

**Corollary**: we can always pullback a given one-form on the image to another differential one-form on the domain of $\phi.$ However, we cannot create a vector field in $\mathbb R^2$ by pushing forward a vector field in $\mathbb R^2,$ unless the function $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism.


The **pullback** for a one-form in $\mathbb R^3,$ or in general $\mathbb R^m,$ which would have the form $\tau_q \in T^*_q\,\mathbb R^m$ (in the cotangent space), and corresponds to $$\tau_q = \sum_{a=1}^m \left. c_a\, dy^a \right|_q$$ with $c_a \in \mathbb R$ being the coefficients, will be given by 


$$\bbox[magenta,15px,border:0.5px solid black]{\color{white}{\phi^*\left( \tau_q\right)= \phi^*  \left(\sum_{a=1}^m \left. c_a\, dy^a \right|_q \right)=\sum_{a=1}^m c_a\, \left( d\phi^a\right)_p = \sum_{i=1}^n\left( \sum_{a=1}^m c_a \left. \frac{\partial \phi^a}{\partial x^i}\right|_p \right)\left. dx^i\right|p\quad}}$$
