### The pushforward:

---

From [page 58 of An Introduction to Differential Geometry through Computation by Mark E. Fels](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=oer_textbooks):

Let $\phi: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$ be a $C^\infty$ function and let $p \in \mathbb R^n$. The function $\phi$ can be used to define a function

$$\phi_{∗,p} : T_p \mathbb R^n \to T_{\phi(p)}\mathbb R^m$$

The map  is $\phi_{*,p}$ called **the pushforward**, the differential, or the Jacobian of $\phi$ at the point $p.$

 
The **pushforward** of the tangent vector to a curve $\sigma$ at $p = \sigma(t_0)$
is the tangent vector of the image curve $\phi(\sigma)$ at $q = \phi(\sigma(t_0)).$ That is,

$$\phi_{∗,p}\;\dot\sigma(t_0) = \phi_{∗,p}\;X_p =\left. \left ( \frac{d}{dt}\, \phi \; \circ \; \sigma \right)  \right|_{t=t_0}$$ 

For the tangent vector $X_p = \dot \sigma (t_0)$ where $p = \sigma(t_0).$ In coordinates:

$$ X_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \left. \frac{d\,\sigma^i}{dt} \right|_{t=t_0} \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$$



For the curve $\phi(\sigma(t)),$ let $Y_q$ be the tangent vector at $q = \phi(\sigma(t_0))$ which is


$$\begin{align}
Y_q  &= \sum_{i=1}^n \left. \frac{d\,\phi^i\left(\sigma(t)\right)}{dt} \right|_{t=t_0} \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\right|_q \\[3ex]
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \; \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \left. \frac{\partial\,\phi^i}{\partial x^j} \right|_p \left. \frac{d\sigma^j}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0} \right) \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\right|_q
\end{align}$$


where $(y^i)_{1≤i≤n}$ denotes the coordinates on the image space of $\phi.$

#### Example

Let $\phi: \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^3$ is given by

$$\phi(x,y) = \left(u=x^2 + y^2, v= x^2 - y^2, w =xy  \right)$$

and the curve $\sigma: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^2$:


$$\sigma(t) = (1 + 3t , 2 - 2t)$$

which at $t=0$ corresponds to 

$$\sigma(0) = (1,2).$$

The derivative is

$$\dot \sigma(t)=(3,-2)$$

which doesn't have any dependency on $t,$ and therefore the tangent vector at $t=0$ is directly given by

$$\left(\dot \sigma(0)\right)_{\sigma(0)}=(3, -2)_{(1,2)}$$

The image curve $\phi \circ \sigma: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^3:$


$$\phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)= \left( (1+3t)^2+(2-2t)^2,\quad (1+3t)^2-(2-2t)^2,\quad (1+3t)(2-2t) \right)$$

and the point mapped from $\sigma(0)=(1,2)$ to $\mathbb R^3$ by $\phi$ is

$$\left. \phi\left(\sigma(t) \right) \right|_{t=0}=(5,-3,2)$$

The tangent vector to the image curve $\phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)$ is [derived](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=Divide%5Bd%2Cdt%5D%5C%2840%29Power%5B%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D+%2B+Power%5B%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D%5C%2844%29Power%5B%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D+%E2%88%92+Power%5B%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%2C2%5D%5C%2844%29%5C%2840%291+%2B+3t%5C%2841%29%5C%2840%292+%E2%88%92+2t%5C%2841%29%5C%2841%29) as

$$\frac d{dt} \phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)=\left(26t - 2, \quad 10t +14,\quad -12t +4  \right)$$

when $t=0$ is


$$\left(\left. \frac{d}{dt} \phi\left( \sigma(t)\right)\right|_{t=0}  \right)_{\phi\left( \sigma(0)\right)} = (-2, 14, 4)_{(5,-3,2)}$$


The map $\phi_{∗,p}$ has the property that if $(\dot σ(t_0))_{σ(t_0)}$
is the tangent vector to the curve $σ$ at $p = σ(t_0)$ with corresponding derivation $X_p$, then $Y_q = \phi_{∗,p}\,X_p$ is the derivation $Y_q$ corresponding to
the tangent vector $\phi \circ \sigma$ at the image point $\phi(p) = \phi(σ(t0)).$ In the example this means $p = (1, 2)$ and $X_p = (3\partial x − 2 \partial y)_{(1,2)}$, and
$Y_q = (−2 \partial u + 14 \partial v + 4 \partial w)_{(5,−3,2)} = \theta_{∗,p}X_p$.
