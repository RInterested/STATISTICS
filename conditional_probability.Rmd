### Conditional Probability:

---

From [this post](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/2055674/152225):

If I toss a biased coin with $2/3$ chance of landing on heads, given that there was at least one head in $3$ flips, what is the probability that there is only $1$ head?

There are $8$ possible outcomes for the three tosses.  As the probabilities for $T,H$ are not the same, these outcomes are not equally probable.

There are seven outcomes that have at least one $H$.  They are $$HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,HTT,THT,TTH$$

The probability that we have at least one $H$ is $$P_{≥1}=1-P(TTT)=1-\left(\frac 13\right)^2=0.962962963$$

How do we compute the conditional probability?  Well, in this case we simply divide the unconditional probability by $P_{≥1}$.  Why?  Well, in general, conditional probability is defined by $$P(A\,|\,B)=\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$ Here $A$ is the event "you get exactly one $H$"  and $B$ is the event "you get at least one $H$".  Of course, in this case $$A\cap B=A\implies P(A\cap B)=P(A)=P(HTT)+P(THT)+P(TTH)$$  Thus our answer is the ratio $$\frac {P(HTT)+P(THT)+P(TTH)}{P_{≥1}}$$

Of course all three of those events, $HTT,THT,TTH$ have the same probability, namely $\left( \frac 13 \right)^2\times \frac 23$.  Thus our numerator is $3\times \left( \frac 13 \right)^2\times \frac 23=\frac 29=.222\cdots$  

Finally the answer we seek is $$\frac {.2222\cdots}{0.962962963}= {0.230769231
}$$

What is the probability of getting a poker hand where all the cards are $7$ or higher if we see that AT LEAST one of the cards is higher than $10$ (i.e. $\text{J, Q, K, A}$)?

The event $\text{A = at least one card }>10$ can occur in the complement of the event that all the cards are less or equal to ten ($36=9\times 4$ lower cards), i.e. $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10:$

$$\binom{52}{5} - \binom{36}{5}$$

over the total sample space:

$$\Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{52}{5} - \binom{36}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

Now, naming the event $\text{B = all cards }\geq 7$, $\Pr(A\cap B)$ will be calculated by considering all the hands with cards equal or greater than $7$: i.e. $7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A$ ($32 = 8 \times 4$), but subtracting those that don't contain any cards higher than $10$ - i.e. hands composed of only $7,8,9,10$ (i.e. $16 =4 \times 4$):

$$\Pr(A\cap B) = \frac{\binom{32}{5} - \binom{16}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

Therefore,

$$\Pr(B\Vert A) = \frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(A)}= \frac{\binom{32}{5} - \binom{16}{5}}{\binom{52}{5} - \binom{36}{5}}$$

Here is the simulation in R:


```{r}
cards = rep(2:14, 4)
m = replicate(1e5, sample(cards, 5, replace = F))
one_ten = m[, colSums(m > 10) > 0, drop=FALSE]
ncol(m[, colSums(one_ten > 6)  == 5, drop=FALSE]) / ncol(m)
```
