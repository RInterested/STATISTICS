### LU DECOMPOSITION:

```{r}
require(Matrix)
set.seed(0)

m = matrix(rnorm(9,6,6), nrow=3) 
(aTa = t(m) %*% m)
```


We need PSD matrix to eventually be able to do the Cholesky decomposition - Our "workhorse" matrix will be, from here on, `aTa`.

But first, the LU Decomposition will be:

```{r}
(U = expand(lu(aTa))$U)
(L = expand(lu(aTa))$L)
L%*%U
```


### LDL DECOMPOSITION:

In LDL' decomposition we separate the diagonal of $U$ from $U$. To make it work $U$ will have to be divided by its diagonal:

```{r}
(D = (diag(diag(U))))

(Udiv = diag(1/diag(U)) %*% U)

L %*% (D %*% Udiv)

#compare to:
aTa
```

### CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION:


We start with the ${\bf LDU} = \begin{bmatrix} \text{lower triangular L}\\ \text{1s on diagonal} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \text{pivot matrix}\\ \text{D is diagonal} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \text{upper triangular U}\\ \text{1s on diagonal} \end{bmatrix}$

**Requirements:** No row exchanges. 

If ${\bf X}$ is symmetric, then ${\bf A = LDL^T}$.

Going further back, the ${\bf LU}$ is asymmetric in that ${\bf U}$ has the pivots on its diagonal, while ${\bf L}$ has $1$'s. To address this we can divide $U$ by the pivots that will now be placed in a diagonal:

$$U=\begin{bmatrix}d_1&&&\\&d_2&&\\&&\ddots&\\&&&d_n \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}1&u_{12}/d_1 & u_{13}/d_1 & \cdots & u_{1n}/d_1\\
&1&u_{23}/d_2&\cdots&u_{2n}/d_2\\&&&\ddots\\&&&&1 \end{bmatrix}$$

To perform the Cholesky decomposition, the matrix has to be symmetric positive semidefinite, so that there are no negative values on the diagonal, because we will get square roots of the diagonal elements. All the pivots have to be positive.

So we take the square root:

$$\begin{bmatrix}\color{red}{\sqrt{d_1}}\sqrt{d_1}&&&\\&\color{red}{\sqrt{d_2}}\sqrt{d_2}&&\\&&\ddots&\\&&&\color{red}{\sqrt{d_n}} \sqrt{d_n}\end{bmatrix}$$

Now the red square roots will multiply the columns of ${\bf L}$, while the black square roots will multiply the rows of ${\bf U}$.

We'll end up with a form ${\bf LL^T}$. It is in a way taking the square root of a matrix.

So to get the Cholesky we need to sqrt the diagonal, and multiply both the columns of $L$ and the rows of `Udiv`:

```{r}
(sqrtD = sqrt(D))
(Lmod = L %*% sqrtD)
(Umod = sqrtD %*% Udiv)
```

This is a good decomposition. It's the Cholesky:

```{r}
Lmod %*% Umod

# returns aTa:

aTa

(Chol = Umod)
chol(aTa)
```
