### CURVATURE:
<br>

Concepts:

 1. Curvature of a curve on a surface.
 2. Extrinsic curvature of the surface itself.
 3. Intrinsic curvature of the surface (Gauss curvature).

##### CURVATURE of a CURVE on a SURFACE (ONE DIMENSIONAL CASE):

In 2D, the tangent to a curved parameterized by arc length $s$ can be thought of as decomposed in Cartesian coordinates as:

$$T(s)=\gamma ' (s) = \cos (\theta(s)) \vec e_1 +\sin(\theta(s)) \vec e_2$$
and the rate of change of $\theta(s),$ that is to say $\theta'(s)$ as the curvature. We can imagine $\theta$ as the steering wheel on a car driving through the curve. However, the curvature is usually denoted as $k(s)=\theta'(s)$ and it is the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle.
