###COMPARING BETWEEN MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS AND WITH OLS:

I will consider three different models from the `sleepstudy` dataset. First off, we need to load two packages: `library(lme4);
library(lmerTest)`.

<br><br>
**MODEL 1: Ordinary Least Squares:**

Syntax: 

`lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)`

<br><br>
**MODEL 2: Random effects intercepts for each level of `Subject` as they deviate from a global intercept, and a global slope:**

Syntax: 

`lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject), sleepstudy)`

<br><br>
**MODEL 3: Random intercepts and slopes with correlation between spread intercepts and slopes:**

The continuous variable `Days` is treated as a fixed effect, and its effect on each level of the categorical variable `Subject`, treated as a random effect, is considered *allowing correlation between the spread of the intercepts across `Subjects` and the `Days` effect deviations across `Subjects` levels*.

Syntax: 

`lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy)`, which is the same as `lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), sleepstudy)` as defined in [this entry in Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/13173/67822).

###RETRIEVING RESULTS:

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
```

```{r}
fm1 <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
summary(fm1)
coef(fm1)
anova(fm1)
```

```{r}
fm2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject), sleepstudy)
summary(fm2)
coef(fm2)
```

```{r}
fm3 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy)
summary(fm3)
coef(fm3)
```

###MODEL SELECTION:

To compare different `lmer` models it's [best to avoid `REML` when the fixed effects are different between models](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/116796/67822). Even though it is not the case in our models I will redefine the models to steer clear of this potential issue:


```{r}
fm2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject), REML = F, sleepstudy)
fm3 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), REML = F, sleepstudy)
```

The [Akaike Information Criteria is a good criterion of the quality of the model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion). It tends to penalize adding extra predictors (overfitting). The models with the [lowest AIC values are best](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/9185/67822).

```{r}
AIC(fm1, fm2, fm3)
```

It seems as though the last model is best in terms of its lowest AIC.

Alternatively we can run [ANOVA tests on the models](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/56157/67822):

```{r}
anova(fm2, fm3)
```
