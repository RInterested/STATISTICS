###MOTIVATION FOR k ORDER STATISTICS:
<br>

A website receives $1\, \text{order}\,/3 \, \text{min}$. The time until the next order follows an exponential distribution with a $\lambda$ rate parameter of $3 \, \text{min}$. Knowing that there were $10$ clients placing orders online from that site last night we want to calculate the expected waiting time for the first and last orders placed after 5pm (night-time period = time $0$). And we want to find out the time of the $k$-th order.

Every order placed cames at a time. This time is the random variable. Since there are 10 orders, we have $X_1, X_2, X_3,...X_{10}$. To make the derivation more generalized, we can consider $X_n$ as the last entry. They are independent of each other, and they are governed by the *pdf* $\lambda\,e^{-\lambda\,x}$, and *cdf* $1 \,-\, e^-{-\lambda\,x}$, where $x$ stands for time. These will be referred as the *common* density and probability functions, because they are shared by all the variables.

The point now is to describe a different variable: the *order* of the observations. So if we imagine that the callers carry a bib number from $1$ to $10$ that links to the times they place their orders, client $X_1$ may end up being the third one to place the order, when ordering the times of the $10$ clients, in which case the new variable will be denoted as $X_{(3)}$. Notice the small parentheses.

The cdf of this new variable for the last order, $n=10$ will be:

$\large F_{x_{(n)}}(x) = P(X_{n}\leq x) = P(\text{all}\,X_i \leq x = \displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^n P(X_n \leq x) = F(x)^n$, since they are independent and identically ditributed.

In the case of the exponential distribution: $\left (1 - e^{-\lambda\,x \,}\right)^n.$

On the other hand the pdf is:

$\large \frac{d}{dx}\,F_{x_{(n)}}(x) = n\,(F(x))^{n-1}\, f(x) = n\,\left (1 - e^{-\lambda\,x \,}\right)^{n-1}\,\lambda\,e^{-\lambda x}.$


On the other hand the pdf and cdf for the first order placed are:

$\large F_{x_{(1)}}(x) = 1 - P(X_{(1)} \geq x) = 1 - P(\text{all} X_i > x)= 1 - (1 - F(x))^n = 1 - (1 - (1 - e^{\lambda x}))^n$
