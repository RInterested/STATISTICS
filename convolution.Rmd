###FINDING THE PDF OF $Z = X + Y$:

<br>

We are given the joint pdf. For instance in the case of the uniform distribution:

$\large f_{XY}(x,y)= I_{(0,a)}\times I_{(0,b)}$

and we want to find the pdf of $f_Z(z)$ when $Z=X+Y$.

We start with the distribution function:

$F_Z(z) = P(Z \leq z) = P(X+Y \leq z)$ to later obtain the pdf through the derivative.

This is what would go on integrating under the bivariate uniform:

In general, we would have to integrate as follows:

$\color{orange}{F(z)} = P(Z \leq z) = P(X + Y  \leq z) = \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \color{orange}{\int_{-\infty}^{z-y} f_{XY} (x,y)\, dx} \, dy$

To take the derivative on both sides of the equation we have to use Leibniz rule because $z$ is in the limits of integration of the expression in orange. In trying to get the derivative of a function like that we do:


$\frac{d}{dx} \left (\displaystyle \int_\color{red}{{b(x)}}^\color{red}{{a(x)}} f(x,t) \, dt \right) =\displaystyle \int_\color{red}{{b(x)}}^\color{red}{{a(x)}}\, \frac{\partial f(x,t)}{\partial x}\,dt + \color{blue}{f(a(x), x)} \, \color{red}{a'(x)} - \color{blue}{f(b(x), x)} \color{red}{ \, b'(x)}\tag {*}$

In what follows, though we have not just $x$ and $t$, but rather $z$, $y$ and $x$, which makes it a bit confusing. Keep in mind that we are differentiating with respect to $z$ ($z$ being the "new player" not in the two-variable equation (*)) and the new $x$ will play the role of the old $t$, while $y$ will play the role of the old $x$:

\begin{align}
f(Z) =& \frac{dF_z (z)}{dz}\\\\
=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \color{orange}{\frac{d}{dz} \int_{-\infty}^{z-y} f_{XY}(x,y)\,dx} \right]\,dy \\\\
=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \int_{-\infty}^{z-y} \frac{\partial f_{XY}(x,y)}{\partial z}dx + \color{blue}{\, f_{XY}(z-y,\, y)} \, \color{red}{\frac{d(z-y)}{dz}} - \color{blue}{f_{XY}(b(y),y)} \color{red}{\frac{d(-\infty)}{dz}}   \right] dy\\\\
=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \int_{-\infty}^{z-y} \frac{\partial f_{XY}(x,y)}{\partial z}dx + \color{blue}{\, f_{XY}(z-y,\, y)} \, \color{red}{1} - \color{red}{0}   \right] dy\\\\
=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}   \color{blue}{\, f_{XY}(z-y,\, y)}  \, dy \tag{**}
\end{align}

Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent:

$pdf(Z)=\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{XY}(z-y, \, y) \,dy = \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \, f_{X}(z-y) \, f_{Y}(y) \,dy$

which is the convolution $f_X(z)*f_Y(z)$.
