### RANDOM WALK:


$$X_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i $$

with $$\Pr(X_i = 1) = p, \;\;\; \Pr(X_1 = -1) = q$$

where if $p=q$ we have a simple, symmetric random walk, whereas if $p \neq q$ we have a random walk with drift. See [here](https://www.softcover.io/read/bf34ea25/math_for_finance/random_walks).

Brownian motion is the continuous time equivalent.

Now, from [here](https://quant.stackexchange.com/q/19454/31759), a random walk is different from white noise, which is stationary, has constant variance, and no autocorrelation. The variance of a random walk is increasing.

In a random walk,

$$x_{t+1} = x_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}$$

with $\varepsilon$ being white noise.

#### MULTIPLICATIVE STOCHASTIC PROCESS:

Will follow a lognormal or power-law distribution as explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA1pkyanbzw&ab_channel=ComplexityExplorer).

Geometric Brownian motion comes instead as the limit of a **multiplicative random walk** : look at an initial stock price, $X_0,$ multiplied by factors $\varepsilon_i$ at each time step:

$$X_n=X_0 \; \varepsilon_1\;\varepsilon_2 \;\cdots\; \varepsilon_n.$$

Therefore we will have

$$x_{t+1} = x_t  \varepsilon_{t+1}$$

where $\varepsilon$ can be a variable interest rate.

If we model these $L_i$ as independent and identically distributed random variables, applying the logarithm allows us to write the equation additively:

$$\ln X_n=\ln X_0+ \sum_{i=1}^n\ln \varepsilon_i$$


The Central Limit Theorem applies, and $\sum_{i=1}^n\ln \varepsilon_i$ is a sum of random variables, and it is distributed normally independently of the distribution of $\varepsilon$. Consequently, $\ln X_n$ is distributed normally as more terms are added, and $\ln X_0$ becomes less significant. So $X$ is log-normally distributed. Positive normal variables that multiply together are log-normal in distribution: investments, city size...

But, if there is a lower bound to $X_n,$ then $X$ will be distributed as a power law.

#### MARKOV PROCESS and AR(1):

From [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/23789/67822) a Markov process fulfills:

$$P(X_{t} = x_t | {\rm entire \ history \ of \ the \ process }) = P(X_{t}=x_t| X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})$$

and an AR(1) process is

$$X_{t} = c + \varphi X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}$$

Hence, a Markov process is an AR(1) process.
