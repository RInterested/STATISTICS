###SURVIVAL ANALYSIS:
<br>


The following is extracted from [this lectures](https://youtu.be/vX3l36ptrTU):


The survival function is

$$S(t)- F_T(t)=1-\left ( 1- e^{-\lambda t}  \right)=e^{-\lambda t} =e^{\text{Haz }t}$$

where $F_T(t)$ is the distribution of the exponential.

the rate $\lambda$ is the hazard, which is estimated as

$$\text{Haz}= e^{b_0 +b_1 X_1+\cdots+b_nX_n}$$

Alternatively,

$$\log(\text{Haz})= b_0 +b_1 X_1+\cdots+b_nX_n$$

$b_0$ is the log hazard for reference at $t=0.$

In the exponential model $b_0$ is a constant. In the Weibull, $'b_0'$ changes proportionally with time (accelerated failure):

$$'b_0'= \log(\alpha) +\log(t) +b_0.$$

In the Cox proportional hazard model, $b_0$ is a function of time:

$$b_0= \log(h_0(t))$$

$h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function. However the function needs not be specified, although at the expense of not being able to estimate the survival function (not a predictive model (estimating survival)). The model alloows us to calculate the other coefficients, and their hazard ratios: $e^{b_i},$ which tell us how survival is affected by each variable (effect size).

The kaplan-Meier can be predictive, but doesn't allow calculating hazard ratios.

The assumptions of the Cox HP model are:

1. Non-informative censoring (points censored are neither more or less likely to die. This is common to all other models
2. Survival times are independent. This is common to all other models.
3. Hazards are proportional (hazard ratios are constant over time). This can be tested with the c-log-log plot and the Schoenfeld's test. This is also assumed in exponential and Weibull. If this is not fulfilled, the coefficients in the regression can be allowed to change over time by including interactions.
4. Log of the hazard is a linear function of the variables. Check with residual plots. This is also assumed in exponential and Weibull. Otherwise, the variables can be transformed or polynomial regression can be attempted.
5. Values of the dependent variables do not change over time. Remedied with time-dependent covariates model.
6. Baseline hazard ($h_0$) is un-specified.

head(d)
m <- survfit(Surv(d$time,d$status) ~ 1,  type='kaplan-meier')

plot(m, mark.time=T, conf.int = F)


mod <- survfit(Surv(d$time,d$status) ~ d$over5, type='kaplan-meier')
mod
plot(mod, mark.time=T, conf.int=F, col=c('firebrick','tan'), main='KM Model', ylab='S(t)', xlab='time (days)')
legend(800,0.9, legend=c('Under 55', 'Over 55'), col=c('firebrick','tan'), lty=1, lwd=2, bty='')

# Log rank test:

survdiff(Surv(d$time,d$status) ~ d$over55,)
```

Running an exponential model:

```{r}
summary(survreg(Surv(time, status) ~ age+sex, data=lung, dist="exponential") )
```

Survival analysis examines and models the time it takes for events to occur, termed survival time. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model is the most common tool for studying the dependency of survival time on predictor variables.

The documentation for the package is [here](https://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/appendix/Appendix-Cox-Regression.pdf).

In type 1 censoring, the investigator defines the period of observation as a fixed value. In type 2 censoring, the investigator defines the period of observation as a random variable after $d$ number of failures. 

  1. Survival Function $S(t):$ 

The probability that a person survives longer than the specified time. This is often expressed by Kaplan Meier Curve. This function can be thought as the complement of cumulative density function.

$$S(t) = P(T>t) = 1- P(T \le t)$$


  2. Probability density function (pdf) $f_{T}(t)$: 
  

$$f_{t}(t)= -S'(t)= \lim_{\delta \to 0^+} P(t \le T < t+\delta)$$

to recover the survivor function, it is always possible to take the integral of probability density function.

  3. Hazard Function: 
  
The hazard function $h(t)$ is defined as instantaneous potential per unit time for the event to occur given that the individual has survived up to time $t$. In contrast to the survival function, hazard function focuses on the event of failing. The higher hazard function, the worse the impact on survival. The hazard function is defined as a rate rather than probability, the values of hazard function range between zero and infinity.

According to Cox and Oakes, knowing the survivor function is sufficient enough to be able to derive Hazard Function.

$$h(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \Pr(t\le T < t+\delta|T>t)/ \delta$$

by definition of conditional probability,

$$h(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \Pr\frac{(t\le T < t+\delta) \cap (T > t)}{ \delta \times \Pr(T>t)}$$

$$h(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\Pr(t\le T < t+\delta)/\delta}{\Pr(T>t)}$$

By definition, hazard function is just pdf divided by survivor function.

$$h(t) = f_{T}(t) / S(t)$$

#####COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARD MODEL:
<br>

Cox-Proportional Hazard Model is a semiparametric hazard model. This proportional hazard model has two major components in the equation:

$\mbox h(X,T) = h_0 (t)  \exp {\left(\sum_i(\beta_iX_i)\right)}$ Where $h_o(t)$ is the baseline hazard, and $\exp{(\sum_i(\beta_iX_i))}$ is the exponential term. The major advantage of Cox-Proportional hazard model is that the baseline hazard does not need to be specified/semiparametric. In addition to that the exponential term of this Cox-Proportional Hazard Model will ensure that the Hazard function will always be non-negative.

One of the assumption of Cox-Proportional Hazard model is the time-independent covariates, or the covariates must not be changing over time. The Covariates like smoking status will easily failed this assumption, because people can change their smoking habit. For this reason, there are extension of this cox-proportional hazard model using joint probability technique.

There are Three Statistical Objectives in Cox-Proportional Hazard model: 
   1. Test for significance of the effect. 
   2. Point estimate of the effect 
   3. Convidence-Interval of the effect.
