What $n$ sample size would be required to get a power of $80\,\%$, which is a common benchmark in the sciences?

For a one-sided test ($H_a: \mu_a > \mu_o$):

$\Large=\,0.8\Big(Z> \, z_{1-\alpha} -\frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu=\mu_a\Big)$


We set $z_{1-\alpha} - \frac{\mu_a -\mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}} = z_{0.2}$ and solve for $n$.

In the cases of $H_a: mu_a \neq mu_o$ we can just take one of the sides but with $\alpha/2$.
