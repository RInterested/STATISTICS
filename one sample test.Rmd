The one-sample t-test is used when we want to know whether our sample comes from a particular population but we do not have full population information available to us.

We test whether the population mean is bigger than a reference accepted value based on a sample.

We compare the sample mean, $\bar X$ to a constant $C$ so that the probability of a type I error is $\alpha$, which is typically $0.05$ or $5\%$:

$\Large 0.05 = p\,(\bar X \geq C) | \mu_o=30$
<br><br>
$=\Large p(\frac{\bar X - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu_o=30)$
<br><br>
$=\Large p(Z\,\geq\frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}|\mu_o=30)$

<br>

$\Large \frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ `= qnorm(0.95)`


If $n$ is small we will do exactly the same thing but with a $t$ test:

$\Large \frac{C - \mu_o}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ `= qt(0.95, n - 1)`
