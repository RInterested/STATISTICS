### Modular Forms and Möbius transformation:

---

#### Möbius transformation:

A Möbius transformation is ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation)):

In geometry and complex analysis, a Möbius transformation of the complex plane is a rational function of the form

$$f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$

of one complex variable $z$; here the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are complex numbers satisfying $ad − bc ≠ 0.$

In order to plot this transformation using Cartesian coordinates on a computer platform the real and imaginary components will need to be separated.

Using [this post](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1583277/152225):

$$\begin{align}
&\frac {(a_r x - a_i y ) + (a_i x + a_r y) i + b_r + b_i i}
{(c_r x - c_i y) + (c_i x + c_r y) i + d_r + d_i i} \\[3ex]
=
&\frac {(a_r x - a_i y ) + (a_i x + a_r y) i + b_r + b_i i}
{(c_r x - c_i y) + (c_i x + c_r y) i + d_r + d_i i} \\[3ex]
=&\frac {(a_r x - a_i y+ b_r ) + (a_i x + a_r y + b_i) i }
{(c_r x - c_i y+ d_r) + (c_i x + c_r y+ d_i) i} \\[3ex]
= & \left( \frac {(a_r x - a_i y+ b_r ) (c_r x - c_i y+ d_r) + (a_i x + a_r y + b_i) (c_i x + c_r y+ d_i) }
{(c_r x - c_i y+ d_r)^2 + (c_i x + c_r y+ d_i) ^2} \right) \\[3ex]
+ & \left( \frac {(a_i x + a_r y + b_i)(c_r x + c_i y+ d_r) -(a_r x - a_i y+ b_r )(c_i x + c_r y+ d_i ) }
{(c_r x - c_i y+ d_r)^2 + (c_i x + c_r y+ d_i)^2 } \right) i 
\end{align}$$

This is implemented [here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/DRF0L1X2).


#### Modular transformation:

A modular form $f$ is an analytic function defined with a weight $k$ and a modular group.

The transformation of the domain of the modular form is the action of the modular group.See [here](https://youtu.be/AxPwhJTHxSg?si=6kngqW3TkYn6dB8S).

Limiting the $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ to the special linear group $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\in M_2(\mathbb Z): ad-cb=1\right\}$ acting on points on the upper-half of the complex plane:

$$\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(-270deg)}{\circlearrowright} \tau\in \mathcal H$$

with $\mathcal H=\{x+iy: y >0\}$.

This action is a **linear fractional transformation** (a **Möbius transformation**):

$$\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\tau = \frac{a\tau + b}{c\tau+d}$$
Since $\tau \in \mathcal H,$ the result of the transformation will also be in the upper-half plane due to the result:

$$\Im\left( \frac{a\tau + b}{c\tau+d}\right)=\frac{(ad-bc)\,\Im(\tau)}{\vert c\tau +d\vert^2}$$

The Möbius transformations are applications such that $f(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$
are the projective transformations of the complex project line. They form a group called Möbius group, which is the projective linear $\mathbb{PGL}(2, C)$. Möbius transformations are generated by the two following matrices: $S=\begin{bmatrix}-1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$ and $T=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$.

The complete definition of a modular form of weight $k$ for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ is a function in $\mathcal H$ satisfying:

1. $f$ is **holomorphic** (analytical, i.e. there is a local power series expansion in $\mathcal H$)

2. **Modularity condition**:

$$f\left( \frac{a\tau + b}{c\tau+d}\right)= (c\tau + d)^k\; f(\tau)\quad \forall \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z),\; \tau\in\mathcal H$$

Since this applies to all matrices in the group, it follows that it applies to $T=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$, and hence:

$$f\left(\frac{1\cdot \tau + 1}{0\cdot \tau + 1}\right)=f(\tau+1)=(0\cdot \tau +1)^k\,f(\tau)=f(\tau)$$
Therefore $f(\tau +1)=f(\tau),$ and the function is **periodic**.

From the matrix $S=\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ we can conclude that

$$f\left(\frac{0\cdot \tau -1}{1\cdot \tau +0} \right)=f\left(-1/\tau\right)=\tau^k\,f(\tau)$$

A $\tau$ in the upper-half plane outside the unit semicircle will be transformed by $-1/\tau$ into a point within the unit semicircle (less than $1$ in modulus) and reflected through the origin (negative sign). Take a point $\tau = r\,e^{i\theta},$ its inverse is $1/\tau = 1/r\,e^{-i\theta}$ (reciprocal modulus, negative argument). The introduction of a negative sign is equivalent to multiplying by $-1 = e^{i\pi}$, yielding $-1/\tau = 1/\tau e^{i(\pi-\theta)}$ (no change in modulus, argument $\pi -\theta$).

Finally, considering the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}-1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$ we get that

$$f\left(\frac{-1\cdot \tau +0}{0\cdot \tau +1} \right)=f\left(-\tau\right)=(-1)^k\,f(\tau)$$
which implies that if $k$ is odd the function has to be zero, i.e. modular forms have even weights.


3. As $\Im(\tau) \to\infty$, $f(\tau)$ is **bounded**.

This is explained in [here](https://youtu.be/LolxzYwN1TQ?si=aPsM8zy_NYDbEkPX).

In the LMFDB, [modular forms](https://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/) are classified according to **weight** ($k$) and **level**, which is a positive integer $N$ such that $f$ is a modular form on a subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ that contains the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(N)$.

For instance, take the elliptic curve $y^2+y=x^3-x^2$ that Edward Frenkel presents in Numberphile in [here](https://youtu.be/4dyytPboqvE?si=Uhv4J6zy_Ojsj4vZ). It turns out that you can find the curve by plugging the equation in the field "Label or coefficients", and it returns `11.a3 (Cremona label 11a3)` with the corresponding modular form within the information about the elliptic curve:

$$q - 2\,q^2 - q^3 + 2\,q^4 + q^5 + 2\,q^6 - 2\,q^7 - 2\,q^9 - 2\,q^{10} + q^{11} - 2\,q^{12} + \cdots)\\[2ex]=q\,((1-q)^2\;(1-q^{11})^2\;(1-q^2)^2\;(1-q^{22})^2)\;(1-q^{3})^2\;(1-q^{33})^2\cdots$$

The plotting can be carried out in the unit disk (hyperbolic space with the **Poincaré disk model**) (see [here](https://math.uni.lu/eml/assets/reports/2016/visualizing_modular_forms.pdf)).

To understand what it represents we need to define the **fundamental domain**: The fundamental domain is a closed subset $D ⊂ X$ such that $X$ is the union of translates of $D$ under the group action $G$:

$$X = \cup_{g∈G} \;g\,D$$
Due to the fact that the Möbius transformations are generated by $T$ and $S$, the fundamental domain and its copies can be found as

$$A_{n+1} = \{A_n × T, A_n × S, A_n × T^{−1}, A_n × S^{−1}\}$$

with $A_0$ being equal to the original fundamental domain.

Let be $z ∈ H$. We call the order of $z$, and we denote $\text{ord}(z)$,
the smallest number of transformations (among $S,T,T^{−1}$) needed to transform $z$ into a complex number in the fundamental domain. Equivalently, $\text{ord}(z)$ is the minimal number of Möbius transformations needed to transform the fundamental domain into the copy of itself that includes $z$.

If the order of a complex number in the complex half-plane is even, it can be represented in black. This can already result in a nice black and white alternating image.

Using the code in this [Mathematics SE post](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4309925/152225), the disk plot of the [modular form 11.2.a.a ](https://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/11/2/a/a/) of level $11$ and weight $2$ can be created in SageMath, first confirming we have the right form:

```
lv = 11
wt = 2
ModularForms(11, 2).basis()[0]
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
```
Here is the standard Cartesian plot:

And here is the Poincaré disk:

<img width = 500  src = "modular_form_poincare.png">

The visual advantage of the distortion introduced by mapping the upper half-plane (H) to the Poincaré disk is primarily about compactness and global visualization. Here's a breakdown:

1. Compact Representation:

Infinity to Boundary: The upper half-plane extends infinitely in all directions. The Poincaré disk, on the other hand, is a finite, bounded region. This allows us to represent the entire upper half-plane (or at least a large portion of it) within a finite space. 

Complete View: This compact representation makes it possible to visualize the global structure of modular forms and their symmetries in a single, coherent image.

Visualizing Cusps: The "cusp" of the upper half-plane (infinity) is mapped to the boundary of the Poincaré disk. This allows us to visualize the behavior of modular forms near the cusp, which is often crucial for understanding their properties.

2. Visualizing Symmetries:

Conformal Mapping: The mapping from H to the Poincaré disk is a conformal mapping, which means it preserves angles. This is important because it preserves the local geometric properties of the modular forms. 

Global Symmetries: Even though the shapes of the tiles are distorted, the overall symmetries of the modular forms are still visible. The patterns in the Poincaré disk plot reflect the symmetries of the modular group and the modular form itself.

Whole Picture: The distortion allows the viewer to see the whole picture. If the image was created in the upper half plane, then the image would need to be infinitely large to display the same information.

3. Aesthetic Appeal:

Circular Boundary: The circular boundary of the Poincaré disk provides a visually appealing and natural frame for the plot.

Symmetry and Harmony: The circular symmetry of the disk often enhances the visual harmony of the patterns, making them more aesthetically pleasing.

4. Computational Advantages:

Finite Domain: Working within a finite domain (the Poincaré disk) can sometimes simplify numerical computations and plotting algorithms.
