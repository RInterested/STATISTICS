### Calculations with p-adics:

---

This page is not meant to be a formal presentation on p-adics, but rather some basic calculations and snippets of code to clarify some points.

The typical presentation of p-adics focuses on the integers as power sums expanding to infinity on to the left as in $\mathbb Z_3,$ corresponding to the 3-adics. For example, in this system the number $3$ is

$$...00000000000000000011 =  2 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 $$

The negative reals are simply the additive inverses of their positive counterparts, so

$$-1 = ...11111111$$

Because

$$...11111111 + ...00000001 = ...000000$$

since in base $2$ and summing from right to left, $1 + 1 = 0$ and we carry $1$ to the left to add it to the $1$ in the second position in the expression of $-1.$

Now, how are the finite digits to the right of the period on the right calculated, and where do they come from?

The issue comes up in the introduction of $\mathbb Q_p$ numbers. For instance, in the case of the 2-adic expression of $\frac 1{24}$. P-adic numbers can be factored as

$$n = p^k \, \text{unit}$$
where $k$ is an exponent measuring the valuation of the p-adic as $\frac 1{p^k}$, and the $\text{unit}$ is... well quick review:

> A **unit** in a ring is an element that has a multiplicative inverse. In other words, if $a$ is a unit, there exists an element $b$ in the ring such that $a \cdot b = 1$.
> A **zero divisor** is a non-zero element $a$ in a ring such that there exists a non-zero element $b$ where $a \cdot b = 0.$

Therefore, in the case of a fraction:

$$\frac m n = \frac m{p^k} \frac 1{\text{unit}}= \frac 1{\text{unit}}p^{-k}$$

Applying it to the example of $1/24,$ the denominator can be factorized as $2^3 \cdot 3:$

$$\frac 1{24}=\frac 1 3 \cdot 2^{-3}$$

$1/3$ is just the multiplicative inverse of $3,$ which can be obtained in sagemath as:

```
from sage.all import *
from sage.rings.padics.padic_printing import pAdicPrinter
padic_printing.mode('digits')
print(Qp(2)(1/3))
# ...10101010101010101011
```

and easily confirmed to be accurate:

```
third = Qp(2)(1/3)
three = Qp(2)(3)
print(third * three)
# ...00000000000000000001
```
Therefore,

$$1/24 = ...10101010101010101011 \cdot 2^{-3}$$

but since we are operating in base $2,$ the factor $2^{-3}$ just moves the period to the right, like $10^{-3}$ would in base $10.$ In this way, we get the final result:

$$1/24...10101010101010101.011$$

or in sagemath

```
padic_printing.mode('digits')
print(Qp(2)(1/24))
...10101010101010101.011
padic_printing.mode('series')
print(Qp(2)(1/24))
2^-3 + 2^-2 + 1 + 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^8 + 2^10 + 2^12 + 2^14 + 2^16 + O(2^17)
```
