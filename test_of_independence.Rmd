###TESTS OF INDEPENDENCE:
<br>

<br><br>

In the [test of proportions](http://rinterested.github.io/statistics/tests_of_proportions.html) we used the $\chi^2$ *goodness-of-fit* to assess whether the proportion of patients suffering heartburn was different depending on whether they take Drug A or Drug B. 

Now we can use the $\chi^2$ test to [assess independence](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Statistical_analysis/Frequency_tests/).

The best illustration is Agresti's example with husband and wife marital satisfaction:

```{r}
sex_satis <- matrix(c(7,2,1,2,7,8,5,8,2,3,4,9,3,7,9,14), nrow = 4)
dimnames(sex_satis) = list(wife = c("Never","Sometimes","Often","Always"), husband = c("Never","Sometimes","Often","Always"))
sex_satis
```

It is to be excpected that, in general, the satisfaction of a spouse moves together with the other. 

If we run a $\chi^2$ test we get,

```{r, warning=FALSE}
chisq.test(sex_satis, correct = T)
```

that with a probability of $<\,5\%$ of making a type I error, the counts in the table cannot be considered independent - we reject the $H_o$ hypothesis of independence, and assume that there is an association between the satisfaction of the husband and the wife.

In this test, the margins are considered fixed, and the expected counts calculated as follows:

Compare this to the way the expected counts are counted on a goodness-of-fit test:

which is *IDENTICAL* numerically, and only different in concept. In the test of independence, we are considering the $\small probability\,(husband=Never\,\&\,wife=Never) = p\,(H=N)*p(W=N)$ under the null hypothesis. So the estimated probability is 

$\small p(H="N",W="N")=\frac{19}{91}\frac{19}{91}$. Hence, the expected counts will be: $\frac{19}{91}\frac{19}{91}*91$.

So for both types of tests (comparison of frequencies (goodness-of-fit) and test of independence) it is valid to just calculate $n_{i+}*n_{+j}/n$.

The test statistic will be:

$\sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$ with $\small df = (rows-1)*(cols - 1)$
