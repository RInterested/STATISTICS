For parameter changes and options of the `igraph()` package, [this](https://kateto.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Polnet%202016%20R%20Network%20Visualization%20Workshop.pdf) is a reference.

To generate a random graph with the package `igraph()` the call is as follows:

```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

#### GENERATING RANDOM UNDIRECTED GRAPHS:


```{r}
library(igraph)
set.seed(5)
g = sample_gnp(30, 0.1, directed=F)
plot(g, 
     vertex.size=20, 
     vertex.color ='black',
     vertex.label.cex=1.2,
     vertex.label.color='white',
     edge.width=2,
     edge.color='red')
```

There number of nodes or vertices is the first entry ($30$), and the probability of having an edge or connection between any two vertices is $0.1.$ The graph is un-directed.

The plotting is rather random, but it can be controlled as follows:


```{r}
plot(g, 
     vertex.size=20, 
     vertex.color ='black',
     vertex.label.cex=1.2,
     vertex.label.color='white',
     edge.width=2,
     edge.color=rgb(.6,.2,.8,.4),
     layout=layout_in_circle(g))
```

It is possible to take a random walk through the graph as follows:

```{r}
# Graph name, starting point, number of steps, what to do if stuck:
random_walk(g, 9, 10, stuck='return')
```
