###OUTPUT OF LM IN R WITH INTERACTIONS:

<br><br>

Considering the `mtcars` data set an the model `lm(mpg ~ wt * hp)`, where `mpg` is regressed on the explanatory variables weight and horsepower, accountig for interactions, the output is:

```
Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ wt * hp)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)           wt           hp        wt:hp  
   49.80842     -8.21662     -0.12010      0.02785  
   
```


The first coefficient is the intercept. The second is the slope of the mileage on the weight of the car when the horse-power is zero. The third is the slope of the mileage on the horse-power in imaginary, zero weight, cars. The last coefficient is the increase in the slope of `mpg ~ wt` per unit increase in `hp`.

Since it is a continuous variable we can try to see this effect with binning. Dividing `hp` in the lower and upper $50$-th quantiles, and repeating the regressions (this time without interactions):

```{r}
dat1 <- mtcars[mtcars$hp<quantile(mtcars$hp,0.5),]
dat2 <- mtcars[mtcars$hp>quantile(mtcars$hp,0.5),]
(fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, dat1))
(fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, dat2))
```

we see that the slope is less negative for the explanatory variable `weight` in the group with higher `hp`, which is consistent with the initial results above.


Some exploratory plotting:


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

fit        <- lm(mpg ~ wt * hp, mtcars)
fit_no_int <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, mtcars)

plot(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, pch = 20, col = 4, ylim=c(10,50), xlim=c(0,4),
     main = "mpg ~ wt", sub= "interaction in green; gray, no interaction")

abline(a = coefficients(fit)[1], 
       b = coefficients(fit)[2], col = 3, lwd = 2)

abline(a = coefficients(fit_no_int)[1], 
       b = coefficients(fit_no_int)[2], col = 8, lwd = 2)

plot(mpg ~ hp, mtcars, pch = 20, col = 4, xlim=c(0,500),ylim=c(10,50),
     main = "mpg ~ hp", sub= "interaction in green; gray, no interaction")

abline(a = coefficients(fit)[1], 
       b = coefficients(fit)[3], col = 3, lwd = 2)

abline(a = coefficients(fit_no_int)[1], 
       b = coefficients(fit_no_int)[3], col = 8, lwd = 2)
```
