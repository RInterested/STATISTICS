###NATURAL PROCESSES ARE NOT GAUSSIAN:
<br>


[Reference discussion](http://www.askamathematician.com/2010/02/q-whats-so-special-about-the-gaussian-distribution-a-k-a-a-normal-distribution-or-bell-curve/)

Also, this is an interesting paragraph:

> Quantitative variation in scientific data is usually described by the
> arithmetic mean and the standard deviation in the form $\bar x
> \pm\text{SD}$ (...)  This characterization is adequate for and evokes
> the image of a symmetric distribution or, more specifically, the
> normal or Gaussian distribution. As is well known, the latter model
> implies that the range from $\bar x - \text{SD}$ to $\bar x +
> \text{SD}$ contains roughly the middle two thirds (68%) of the
> variation, and the interval $\bar x \pm 2 \text{ SD}$ covers 95%. 
> 
> However, there are numerous examples for which the description by a
> mean and a symmetric range of variation around it is clearly
> misleading. This becomes obvious whenever the standard deviation is of
> the same order as the mean so that the lower end of the 95% data
> interval extends below zero for data that cannot be negative, as is
> the case for most original data in science. In such cases, we say that
> the data fail the ‘‘95% range check.’’ For instance, in investigations
> of health risk, a sample of insulin concentrations in rat blood is
> described by $\bar x \pm\text{SD} = 296 \pm172$. If a normal
> distribution were appropriate, the 95% range would extend from $-48$
> to $640$, and 4% of the animals would have negative insulin values
> which is, of course, impossible.

*Problems with Using the Normal Distribution – and Ways to Improve Quality and Efficiency of Data Analysis Eckhard Limpert, Werner A. Stahel in PLoS ONE, July 2011, vol.6, Issue 7.* 

Interestingly, the authors proposed a more widespread use of the [log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) in scientific research:

Their main power-point style thoughts can be accessed [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/talks/lognormal.pdf).

The use of the Gaussian distribution is firmly anchored in considerations such as the central limit theorem; its [affine transformation properties](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/435829/152225) that come into play in Gaussian processes; or its choice as a conjugate distribution in Bayesian statistics. And I'll stop right here.
