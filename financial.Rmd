### TIME SERIES - FINANCIAL DATA:

From this [R-bloggers](http://programming-r-pro-bro.blogspot.com/2013/04/forecasting-stock-returns-using-arima.html).

```{R, warning=F, message=F}
library(quantmod)
library(tseries)
library(forecast)

DJI = read.csv("^DJI.csv")
DJI$Date <- as.Date(DJI$Date,format="%m/%d/%Y")
rownames(DJI) <- DJI$Date
DJI$Date <- NULL 
head(DJI)
```

```{r}
d = DJI$Adj.Close
summary(d)
chartSeries(DJI)
adf.test(d) 
```

The dataset is not stationary. We will difference and log:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dow = 100 * diff(log(d))[-1]
summary(dow)
adf.test(dow)
```

Now it is stationary.

We can fit a model using the [Yule-Walker equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR_model#Calculation_of_the_AR_parameters)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
summary(arma(dow, order = c(2,2)))
```

So both the AR and MA coefficients are significant.

We can divide instead the data into training and testing sets ($90\,%$ v $10\%$), fit the model in the training data, and then assess the performance on the testing set:

```{r}
train = d[1 : (0.9 * length(dow))]
test  = d[(0.9 * length(dow) + 1):  length(dow)]

fit = arima(log(train), c(2, 1, 2), seasonal=list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period=12))

predi = predict(fit, n.ahead = (length(dow) - (0.9*length(dow))))$pred
fore  = forecast(fit, h = 365 * 5) # Five years ahead

plot(fore)
```

Well, it is an illustration. However, the [accuracy assessment](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5) is not great:

```{r}
accuracy(predi, test)
```

If we calculate without using the `i=1` middle value in `arima`:

```{r}
dow = 100 * diff(log(d))[-1] # The difference taken outside the arima() call. 100 probably aides in computing since the numbers are very close to zero.
train = dow[1 : (0.9 * length(dow))]
test  = dow[(0.9 * length(dow) + 1):  length(dow)]

fit = arima(train, order = c(2, 0, 2), seasonal=list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period=12))

predi = predict(fit, n.ahead = (length(dow) - (0.9*length(dow))))$pred
accuracy(predi, test)
```

At this point I'm not sure how to evaluate these differences in output between both apparently equivalent systems.
