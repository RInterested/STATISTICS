###THE ROLE OF $dx$ AS A FUNCTIONAL:
<br>


From [this post](http://math.blogoverflow.com/2014/11/03/more-than-infinitesimal-what-is-dx/).

<p>With the additional datum of position, vectors become <strong>tangent vectors</strong>. If \(v\) is a vector and \(p\) is a point, then we will use \(v_p\) will denote the tangent vector corresponding to \(v\) at the point \(p\). The reason they are called tangent vectors comes from their use in differential geometry, where a vast, powerful generalization of lines, planes, and other &#8220;Euclidean&#8221; spaces, called a &#8220;(smooth) manifold,&#8221; is used. A circle is an example of such a space, and the tangent line to a point on the circle can be thought of as the set of all tangent vectors to the circle at that point. For the sake of intuition, we will stay within Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Suppose \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}\) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness">smooth</a> function from the real plane to the real line. At each point \(p\in\mathbb{R}^2\), we can take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative">directional derivative</a> of \(f\) in whatever direction we like. For example, if we have coordinates \((x,y)\), then \(\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_p\) is the directional derivative at \(p\) of \(f\) in the direction of increasing \(x\). If we wanted to take the directional derivative at \(p\) of \(f\) in the direction of decreasing \(x\), then we would just negate to obtain  \(-\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_p\).</p>

<p>In fact, if we pick any tangent vector at \(p\), it will correspond to a directional derivative at \(p\) in the direction and with the corresponding magnitude of that tangent vector. Following the above example, taking the directional derivative at \(p\) in the direction of increasing \(x\) is the same as applying \(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\), and going the opposite direction is the same as applying \(-\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\). Taking this a step further, we claim that tangent vectors and directional derivatives are the same thing! This may seem shocking, but all it says is that every tangent vector corresponds to a directional derivative with the same magnitude and direction. If we are working in the plane, then we can therefore identify \(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\) with \(\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T_p\) and \(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right|_p\) with \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T_p\), where \(v^T\) denotes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose">transpose</a> of a vector \(v\).</p>

<p>We use the transpose to use column vectors for tangent vectors. By doing this, we can let row vectors act on them by left multiplication. Note that left multiplying a column vector by a row vector is the same as taking the dot product between those two vectors. Thus, row vectors can be viewed as linear functions from column vectors to the space of real numbers. Attaching these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space">linear functionals</a> to a point as we did with tangent vectors, we obtain <strong>cotangent vectors</strong>, or <strong>covectors</strong>. Hinting at the direction of conversation, in the plane we will denote the covector \(\alpha_p\) that satisfies \(\alpha_p\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\right)=1\) and \(\alpha_p\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right|_p\right)=0\) by \(\mathrm{d}x_p\).</p>

<p>The concept of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a> from multivariate calculus is best seen in the context of tangent vectors. Using our terminology, a <strong>vector field</strong> is simply a function that takes in a point in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and outputs a tangent vector at that point. Similarly, we define a <strong>differential \(1\)-form</strong> as a function that takes in a point in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and outputs a covector at that point. For example, the map $$\mathrm{d}x:p\mapsto\mathrm{d}x_p$$ is a differential \(1\)-form. Thus, \(\mathrm{d}x\) is simply the differential \(1\)-form that takes each point \(p\) of the space to the cotangent vector \(\mathrm{d}x_p\) at \(p\) that satisfies \(\mathrm{d}x_p\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\right)=1\) and \(\mathrm{d}x_p(v_p)=0\) for all \(v_p\not\in\left\langle\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right|_p\right\rangle\).</p>

<p>How could these possibly be interpreted as infinitesimals? I think Spivak explains this best:</p>

<p>&#8220;Classical differential geometers (and classical analysts) did not hesitate to talk about &#8216;infinitely small&#8217; changes \(\mathrm{d}x^i\) of the coordinates \(x^i\), just as Leibnitz (sic) had. No one wanted to admit that this was nonsense, because true results were obtained when these infinitely small quantities were divided into each other (provided one did it in the right way).</p>

<p>&#8220;Eventually it was realized that the closest one can come to describing an infinitely small change is to describe a direction in which this change is supposed to occur, i.e., a tangent vector. Since \(\mathrm{d}f\) is supposed to be an infinitesimal change of \(f\) under an infinitesimal change of the point, \(\mathrm{d}f\) must be a function of this change, which means that \(\mathrm{d}f\) should be a function on tangent vectors. The \(\mathrm{d}x^i\) themselves then metamorphosed into functions, and it became clear that they must be distinguished from the tangent vectors \(\partial/\partial x^i\).&#8221; </p>
