### Conjugation of permutations:

---

The permutation

<img height = 300  src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9312897/195470631-c2e1a9fb-19dc-4163-b634-8ee36d6d3a7c.png">

can be expressed as $$(1 \, 4 \, 3)\;(2 \, 5)$$

in cycle notation, which visually is more clear if we rearrange the permutation graph as

which would allow us to see at once that this permutation is up-to-relabeling identical to

or $$(1 \, 2 \, 3)\;(4 \, 5)$$

They both have the same cycle type, and the first permutation can be turned into the second via a re-labeling map:

which can be expressed as

$$\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$$

Both $\tau$ and $\sigma$ belong to the symmetric group $S_5,$ and $\tau$ could have been any other element (or permutation) in $S_5.$

The new mapping, i.e. $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ will be another element of $S_5$ of the same cycle type as $\sigma,$ and the operation $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ is **conjugation**.

How can we write the cycle decomposition of $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ by relabeling the domain and co-domain of $\sigma$ as
