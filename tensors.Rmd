###TENSOR INDICIAL NOTATION:

#####**Definition of geometric vectors:**

Directed segment (i.e. length and angle). It is not an ordered set of numbers. A vector cannot be decomposed into basis vectors, like in linear algebra. Geometric vector are just pictures.

Without a coordinate system the vectors would just be; with a coordinate system, $\color{blue}{\text{vectors become a function of coordinates.}}$

They can be added with the parallelogram rule. They can be subtracted. And because they can be subtracted, they can also be differentiated:

If there is no change in length the derivative of a directional vector is orthogonal to it:

${\bf v}(t)\cdot{\bf v}(t) = \text{constant}$

The dot vector is an OK operation because it is the length of the vectors times the cosine of the angle between them.

Differentiating, and using the product rule:

$\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}{\bf v}(t) + {\bf v}(t)\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}=0$

Hence,

${\bf v'}(t)\cdot {{\bf v}(t)}=0$
