###TENSOR INDICIAL NOTATION:
<br>

#####**Definition of geometric vectors:**

Directed segment (i.e. length and angle). It is not an ordered set of numbers. A vector cannot be decomposed into basis vectors, like in linear algebra. Geometric vector are just pictures.

Without a coordinate system the vectors would just be; with a coordinate system, $\color{blue}{\text{vectors become a function of coordinates.}}$

They can be added with the parallelogram rule. They can be subtracted. And because they can be subtracted, they can also be differentiated:

If there is no change in length the derivative of a directional vector is orthogonal to it:

${\bf v}(t)\cdot{\bf v}(t) = \text{constant}$

The dot vector is an OK operation because it is the length of the vectors times the cosine of the angle between them.

Differentiating, and using the product rule:

$$\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}{\bf v}(t) + {\bf v}(t)\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}=0$$

Hence,

$${\bf v'}(t)\cdot {{\bf v}(t)}=0 \tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$

#####Covariant basis:

A directional or positional vector $R$ becomes a function of two variables ($r$ and $\theta$) in this polar coordinate system. In general the vector becomes a function of the coordinates $R(Z^1,Z^2)$.

Differentiating will yield the **coordinate vectors of the covariant basis** by definition:

$\large {\bf e_r}= \frac{\partial R(r,\theta)}{\partial r}$

$\large {\bf e_\theta}=\frac{\partial R(r,\theta)}{\partial \theta}$

Here is the intuition behind the derivative definition in the Cartesian system:

Halving the denominator in the $\Delta x$, also halves the vector, yielding the unit vector $i$ along the limit process in $\large \hat i = \frac{\partial R(x,y)}{\partial x}$.

Going back to the radial coordinate system, $e_r$, is going to be the unit vector that points in the radial direction. It is described in words or pictorially - NOT with closed formulas, such as $(r \cos (\theta), r \sin(\theta)).$
