###TENSOR INDICIAL NOTATION:
<br>

#####**Definition of geometric vectors:**

Directed segment (i.e. length and angle). It is not an ordered set of numbers. A vector cannot be decomposed into basis vectors, like in linear algebra. Geometric vector are just pictures.

Without a coordinate system the vectors would just be; with a coordinate system, $\color{blue}{\text{vectors become a function of coordinates.}}$

They can be added with the parallelogram rule. They can be subtracted. And because they can be subtracted, they can also be differentiated:

If there is no change in length the derivative of a directional vector is orthogonal to it:

${\bf v}(t)\cdot{\bf v}(t) = \text{constant}$

The dot vector is an OK operation because it is the length of the vectors times the cosine of the angle between them.

Differentiating, and using the product rule:

$$\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}{\bf v}(t) + {\bf v}(t)\frac{d{\bf v}(t)}{dt}=0$$

Hence,

$${\bf v'}(t)\cdot {{\bf v}(t)}=0 \tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$

#####Covariant basis:

A directional or positional vector $R$ becomes a function of two variables ($r$ and $\theta$) in this polar coordinate system. In general the vector becomes a function of the coordinates $R(Z^1,Z^2)$.

Differentiating will yield the **coordinate vectors of the covariant basis** by definition:

$\large {\bf e_r}= \frac{\partial R(r,\theta)}{\partial r}$

$\large {\bf e_\theta}=\frac{\partial R(r,\theta)}{\partial \theta}$

Here is the intuition behind the derivative definition in the Cartesian system:

Halving the denominator in the $\Delta x$, also halves the vector, yielding the unit vector $i$ along the limit process in $\large \hat i = \frac{\partial R(x,y)}{\partial x}$.

Going back to the radial coordinate system, $e_r$, is going to be the unit vector that points in the radial direction. It is described in words or pictorially - NOT with closed formulas, such as $(r \cos (\theta), r \sin(\theta)).$

At every point, $e_r$ is the unit of length and radially oriented; while $e_\theta$ has length $r$ and is tangential:

The gradient vector will be defined at any point as:

$\large \nabla F = \frac{\partial F}{\partial Z^1}{\bf e_1} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial Z^2} {\bf e_2}$

From [here](https://youtu.be/hiYgYWJEaMk?t=27m50s) and [here](https://youtu.be/rtEk1at3sVk?t=25m24s):

In the Cartesian coordinate system the arc length of a curve can be parametrized with respect to time:

<img width="500" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9312897/18792403/633819da-8184-11e6-89d3-c7b3f4cf5283.png">

$$\text{arc length}= S(t) = \int_{t_0}^t \sqrt{\frac{dR}{dt}\cdot \frac{dR}{dt}}dt$$

The curve now can be fully defined in terms of the covariate coordinates $Z^1$ and $Z^2$ at every point in the arc length $s$. The function would be the derivative over $s$ of:

$$R(s) = \left(Z^1(s), Z^2(s)\right)$$

The unit tangent (unit vector tangential to the curve) is:

$$T(s) = \frac{dR(s)}{ds}=\color{blue}{\frac{\partial R}{\partial Z^1}}\frac{dZ^1}{dS} + \color{red}{\frac{\partial R}{\partial Z^2}}\frac{dZ^2}{dS} = \frac{d Z^1}{ds}\color{blue}{{\bf e_1}} + \frac{dZ^2}{ds} \color{red}{{\bf e_2}}$$
