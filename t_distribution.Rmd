### MOTIVATION FOR THE $t$ DISTRIBUTION:


[What follows was first written in a [post in SE Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1386078/152225)]

<br>

The $t$-Student distribution is a "natural" $pdf$ to define. 

If $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are iid observations $\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, 

<br><br>
$\Large\frac{\bar{X}\,-\,\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1)$. 
<br><br>
And  $\Large\frac{\bar{X}\,-\,\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ is the formula of the Z-statistic.
<br><br>
If the $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are not normally distributed,  the expression will tend to $\sim N(0,1)$ as $n\mapsto\infty$, the basis for the central limit theorem (CLT).

If the standard deviation of the population, $\sigma$, is unknown we can replace it by the estimation based on a sample, $S$, but then the expression ([one-sample t-test statistic][3]) will follow a $t$-distribution:

$\Large \frac{\bar{X}\,-\,\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\sim t_{n-1}$ 


with $\large S=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2}{n-1}}$ (Bessel's correction).

Why?

$$\Large\frac{\bar{X}\,-\,\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\bar{X}\,-\,\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \frac{1}{\frac{S}{\sigma}}= Z\,\frac{1}{\frac{S}{\sigma}} = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2}{(n-1)\,\sigma^2}}} \sim\frac{Z}{\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{n - 1}^2}{n-1}}} \sim t_{n-1}\small \tag 1$$

How did the chi square ($\chi^2$) made its entry into the $pdf$? It's the distribution that models $X^2$ with $X\sim N(0,1)$.

In general, if $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are $\sim \chi^2_{1\,df}$, then  $X_1 +\cdots+X_n \sim \chi^2\,\small(n\text{ df})$ [here][7].

And in the case of the $t$-distribution the chi-square is suitable to model the sum of squared normals $\large \sum(X_i-\bar X)^2$ in (1)), a well known property [derived here][4], typically with $n$ degrees of freedom, but why is it $n\,-\,1$ here? In other words, why...

$\Large \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar X)^2}{\sigma^2}$ in equation (1) becomes $\Large \chi_{n-1}^2$ and not $\Large \chi_{n}^2$?

The explanation is in the [answer here][5].

In a nutshell, there aren't $n$ $X_i$ independently distributed random variables corresponding to the different observations, each one following a $\chi^2$ distribution when squared ($\small(X-\bar X)^2$). In fact there are only $n-1$ because of the insertion of the $\bar X$ in the mix.

<br><br>

###DERIVATION OF THE $pdf$ OF THE $t$ DISTRIBUTION:

<br><br>

First let's recapute equation (1) by multiplying by $\frac{\sigma}{\sigma}$ the Z-statistic $\Large \frac{\bar X - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$:

$\Large t= \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}}{\sqrt{S^2/\sigma^2}} = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2}{(n-1)\,\sigma^2}}} \small \tag1$                          

In the above expression, $(\bar{X}-\mu)/(\mu/\sqrt{n})\,\,\sim \,\,N(0,1)$ 

<br><br>

and $\sqrt{S^2/\sigma^2} =\sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{x=1}^n(X - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}/\sigma^2} \,\,\sim \,\,\sqrt{\chi_{(n-1)}^2/(n-1)}$.

<br><br>

Assigning $U = (\bar{X}-\mu)/(\mu/\sqrt{n})$ and $V=\sqrt{S^2/\sigma^2}$, characterized as $U \sim N(0,1)$ and $V \sim \chi_k^2$, expression [1] becomes $U/\sqrt{V/k}$.

<br><br>

With the premise of independence, the joint density is:

<br><br>

$\Large f_{U,V}(u,v) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}} e^{-u^2/2} \frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})\,2^{k/2}}\,v^{(k/2)-1}\, e^{-v/2}$ with  $-\infty<u<\infty$ and $0<v<\infty$.

<br><br>

Making the transformation $\Large t=\frac{u}{\sqrt{v/k}}$ and $\Large w=v$, (hence, $\Large u=t\,(\frac{w}{k})^{1/2}$), and with $\Large (w/k)^{1/2}$ as the Jacobian, the marginal pdf will be:

<br><br>

$\large f_T(t) = \int_0^\infty \,f_{U,V}\bigg(t\,(\frac{w}{k})^{1/2},w\bigg)(w/k)^{1/2}dw$

<br><br>

$=\Large  \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})2^{k/2}}\,
 \int_0^\infty\,
e^{-\frac{\bigg(t(\frac{w}{k})^{1/2}\bigg)^2}{2}}
w^{(k/2)-1}
e^{-(\frac{w}{2})}
\frac{w^{1/2}}{k^{1/2}}\,dw$

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\Large \int_0^\infty\,
w^{((k+1)/2)-1}\,
e^{-(1/2)(1 + t^2/k)w}
\,dw$

<br><br>

The next step entails identifying in the previous equation the kernel of a gamma distribution pdf:

<br><br>

$\Large x^{\alpha-1}\,e^{x\,\lambda}$

<br><br>

with parameters $\large (\alpha=(k+1)/2,\,\lambda=(1/2)(1+t^2/k))$.
<br><br>
The generic pdf for the gamma distribution is,


$\Large \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\,x^{\alpha-1}\,e^{x\,\lambda}$

<br>
The strategy is then to synthesize the entire gamma pdf within the improper integral in our $f_T(t)$ pdf in progress, so that we can simplify it as just $1$, as we know to be true of all pdf's. To get away with it we need to multiply numerator and denominator by the same coefficient:


$\Large \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\,\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)\,\lambda^\alpha}$. And since neither $\alpha$ nor $\lambda$ include the integrating factor $w$ we can include them inside the integral, or leave them out. Naturally, we want to leave within the integral $\Large \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}$, and keep $\Large \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\lambda^\alpha}$ outside the integral. Now $f_T(t)$ will look hideous for just one second:

<br><br>

$\Large= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\int_0^\infty\frac{((1/2)(1+t^2/k))^{(k+1)/2}}{\Gamma((k+1)/2)}$
$w^{((k+1)/2)-1}
e^{-(1/2)(1 + t^2/k)w}
dw\,
\frac{\Gamma((k+1)/2)}{((1/2)(1+t^2/k))^{(k+1)/2}}$

<br><br>

... because everything between $\int$ and $dw$ is just the gamma $pdf$ integrated over its entire support, so it becomes $1$, and we are left with:

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\frac{\Gamma((k+1)/2)}{((1/2)(1+t^2/k))^{(k+1)/2}}$

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,\Gamma((k+1)/2)\,
\Big[\frac{2}{(1+t^2/k)}\Big]^{(k+1)/2}$

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}\,
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\Big[\frac{2}{(1+t^2/k)}\Big]^{(k+1)/2}$

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}\,
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}2^{k/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\frac{2^{(k+1)/2}}{(1+t^2/k)^{(k+1)/2}}$

<br><br>

$=\Large \frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}\,
\frac{1}{(\pi)^{1/2}k^{1/2}}\,
\frac{1}{(1+t^2/k)^{(k+1)/2}}$

<br><br><br><br>

$\Large f_T(t)= \frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}\,
\frac{1}{\sqrt{k\,\pi}}\,
\Big(1+\frac{t^2}{k}\Big)^{-\frac{k+1}{2}}$

<br><br>

which is the $pdf$ of the $t$-Student or Gosset distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom.
