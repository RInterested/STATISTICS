#### SIMULATION OF THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM:

Simulating the central limit theorem, ending up with plots side-by-side showing the bell-curve distribution of an originalNormal distribution with chosen mean and SD, which will be broad-based, as compared to the distribution of the sample means, also bell-shaped, but narrower at the base.

```{r}
set.seed(2)
CentralLimit <- function(n){
     means_of_samples <<-numeric()
     for (i in 1:n){
         means_of_samples <- c(means_of_samples,mean(rnorm(sampsize,mean,sd)))
}
     samples_means <<- means_of_samples    ##The << makes the object available outside the function.
     sd(samples_means)                     ## although only the sd of the samples_means will be returned
}
```


Now were are going to decide on a sample size, mean and standard deviation:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sampsize <- 100
mean <- 0
sd <- 1000
CentralLimit(1000)
# [1] 105.7034      Very close to theoretical: sd/sqrt(n) 1000/sqrt(100) = 100.
head(samples_means)
# [1]  -30.69816   29.21465  142.93250  314.10070 -147.08809  252.46291 

# Building up the population distribution using the dnorm, which will give the pdf value for every quantile fed into it:
x   <- seq(-(5 * sd),(5 * sd), length = 1000)
y   <- dnorm(x, mean, sd)
```

Plotting,

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2),oma=c(0,0,1,0))
plot(x,y, type="l",ylab="pdf",xlab="population",
     frame = FALSE, col="dark blue", lwd=2, yaxt="n")
# And now the histogram of the sample means distribution:
hist(samples_means, freq = F, yaxt="n", main = "",
     xlim=c(-(5 * sd(samples_means)),(5 * sd(samples_means))))
     
x <- seq(-(5 * sd(samples_means)),(5 * sd(samples_means)),
         length=1000)
curve(dnorm(x,mean=mean(samples_means),
            sd=sd(samples_means)),col="red",lwd=2,add=T)
