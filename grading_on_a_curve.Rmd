### Grading on a Curve (Peer-to-Peer grading):

---


#### The students:

```{r}
n <- 150     # Number of students
x <- expand.grid(rep(list(c(LETTERS)), 2))
options <- do.call(paste0, x)
names   <- sample(options, size = n, replace = T)
```

#### The points - raw test scores:

```{r}
points  <- c(sample(seq(40, 50, 0.1), 15, replace = T), 
             sample(seq(50, 60, 0.1), 46, replace = T),
             sample(seq(60, 70, 0.1), 25, replace = T),
             sample(seq(70, 80, 0.1), 47, replace = T),
             sample(seq(80, 100, 0.1), 17, replace = T))

data <- data.frame(names, points)

hist(points, xlim=c(0,100), border = F, col = 'tan') # Not normal
shapiro.test(points)                    # ... with high degree of certainty...
qqnorm(points)                                  # ...even visually.
```

#### Grading on the curve:

```{r}
cutoffs <- quantile(points, probs = pnorm(seq(-2,2))) # Select quantiles with frequency distr like SD of N(0,1)

data$final <- cut(data$points,
                     breaks=c(-Inf,cutoffs,+Inf),
                     labels=c(LETTERS[6:1])) # And we assign final grades based on these cutoffs

barplot(prop.table(table(data$final))) # Now they look normal


(freq_distr <- prop.table(table(data$final))) # These is how the grades are distributed.
(Normal_distr <- c(pnorm(-2), pnorm(-1) - pnorm(-2), pnorm(0) - pnorm(-1),
                  pnorm(1) - pnorm(0), pnorm(2) - pnorm(1), pnorm(2, lower.tail = F))) 
# This is how the normal would have them.
chisq.test(freq_distr, p = Normal_distr) #And the GOF confirms normality.
```


Alternatively, the percentile can be given as the final grade, or used as an additional grade (percentile + ordinal score):

```{r}
zscores <- scale(points) # Normalizes the points
mean(zscores); sd(zscores) #N(0,1)
hist(zscores, breaks = 18, border = F, col = 'tan') # The data distribution is normalized but not distributed normally
percentiles <- pnorm(zscores) * 100
plot(percentiles, pch = 20, col = 2)
```

At this point we can assign the percentiles as the final grade:

```{r}
data$percentiles <- round(percentiles)
tail(data)
```

Or we can assign grades based on percentiles as we did with "points":

```{r}
cutoffs <- quantile(percentiles, probs = pnorm(seq(-2,2)))
data$alternative <- cut(data$percentiles,
                  breaks=c(-Inf,cutoffs,+Inf),
                  labels=c(LETTERS[6:1])) # And we assign final grades based on these cutoffs
tail(data)
barplot(prop.table(table(data$alternative)))
```
