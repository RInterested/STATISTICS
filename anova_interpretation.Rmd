###INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS OF AN ANOVA TEST IN R:
<br>

Let's create three normally distributed samples with the same variance, but different means, and run an anova in R:

```{r}
set.seed(1); n = 50; x1 = rnorm(n, 10, 3); x2 = rnorm(n, 15, 3); x3 = rnorm(n, 20, 3)
dataframe = data.frame(x1,x2,x3)
boxplot(dataframe, col=c("wheat4", "tan", "tan3"))
```

Now let's calculate the anova manually:

```{r}
datamatrix = as.matrix(dataframe)
(global.mean = mean(datamatrix))                                    # The overall mean
(group.means = apply(datamatrix, 2, mean))                          # The respective means for each group
(SST = sum((datamatrix - global.mean)^2))                           # Sum squares total
(SSBetween = sum(nrow(datamatrix) * (group.means-global.mean)^2))   # Between groups
(SSWithin = sum(scale(datamatrix, center = T, scale = F)^2))        # Sum Squares Residuals
(MeanSqBetween = SSBetween / (ncol(datamatrix) - 1))                # Between/df(groups - 1) [3 - 1]
(MeanSqWithin = SSWithin / (length(datamatrix) - ncol(datamatrix))) # Within/df(subjects - no.groups) [150-3]
(F_value = MeanSqBetween / MeanSqWithin)                            # F value
```

Compare to the R function. First let's ready up the data:

```{r}
datalong = stack(dataframe)
summary(aov(values ~ ind, datalong))
```
