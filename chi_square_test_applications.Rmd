###APPLICATION OF THE CHI SQUARE TEST:


<br><br>

####GENERAL TEST STATISTIC (regardless of specific application):

The chi square statistic is denoted as $\chi^2=\displaystyle \sum_i \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}$ where $O_i$ is the observed number of cases in category $i$, and $E_i$ is the expected number of cases in category $i$. 


The null and alternative hypotheses for each chi square test are:

$H_o: O_i=E_i$ and $H_1:O_i\neq E_i$.

The theoretical distribution is a continuous distribution, but the $\chi^2$ statisticis obtained in a discrete manner, on the basis of discrete differences betweenthe observed and expected values. Hence, there is a need for asymptotics: The condition in which the chi square statistic is approximated by the theoretical chi square distribution, is that the sample size is reasonably large: there should be at least $5 \,expected \,cases$ per category.

####1. GOODNESS-OF-FIT TEST:

<br>

This test concerns itself with checking whether the sample is consistent with a theorized population distribution. Examples:

1. Is there the same number of customers each day visiting a store (the answer will determine staffing needs)? In other words, is the distribution uniform?

2. Have the grades of the students been allocated using a bell distribution?

3. Does a sample follow the distribution of the population in a science project?

When dealing with continuous variable there will be a need to discretize by grouping the observations in bins through, for instance, quantiles. The total of the number of cases has to be made equal to the total number of expected values.

<br>

####2. TEST of INDEPENDENCE of TWO VARIABLES:

<br>

It is based on the analysis of a cross classification on a contingency table to test the possible dependency or relationship between variables.

he assumptions on which these tests arebased are minimal, although a certain minimum sample size is usually re-quired. The variables which are being examined can be measured at anylevel, nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.  The tests can thus be used inmost circumstances.
