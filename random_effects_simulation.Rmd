###Regression of `[GLUCOSE] ~ [AMINOACID_A]` in 30 athletes after 15 races:

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(lme4)
set.seed(0)
```

<br>

All the data is fictitious, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/RInterested/SIMULATIONS_and_PROOFS/blob/master/athletes%20mixed%20effects).


####Data set manufacturing process:

We'll make the `sd` of the *slopes between athletes* `0.5`, and the `sd` between *intercepts of different athletes* `0.2`. Further we'll establish a *correlation between intercepts and slopes* of `0.8`.

#####FOR ATHLETES:

The covariance matrix will be:

```{r}
i = 0.2 # sd between intercepts
s = 0.5 # sd between slopes
r = 0.8 # correlation between intercepts and slopes
# The higher the intercept of an athlete; the higher the slope - could be the opposite...
(cov.matrix1<-  matrix(c(i^2, r * i * s, r * i * s, s^2), nrow = 2, byrow = T))
```


Getting a random sample from this bi-variate normal distribution for each athlete:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
athletes = 30
require(mvtnorm)
random.effects_athletes <-  rmvnorm(athletes, mean = c(0, 0), sigma = cov.matrix1)
```

We establish now the mean of these random intercepts (`alpha_ath`) and slopes (`beta_ath`):

```{r}
athletes.df = data.frame(athlete  = c(1:athletes)) # Just a column of numbers from 1 to 30
athletes.df$alpha_athletes = 1 + random.effects_athletes[, 1]
athletes.df$beta_athletes =  2 + random.effects_athletes[, 2]

summary(athletes.df$beta_athletes)  # The mean is the slope in the fixed effects: 2 + random.effects[,2])
sd(athletes.df$beta_athletes)       # The sd of the slopes as random effects (we wanted 0.5)
summary(athletes.df$alpha_athletes) # The intercept has a mean of 1: (Intercept) fixed eff's
sd(athletes.df$alpha_athletes)      # with a SD intercept as random eff (we wanted 0.2)
cor(athletes.df$alpha_athletes, athletes.df$beta_athletes) # Set at 0.8.
```


#####FOR RACES:

The covariance matrix will be:

```{r}
i =   0.8   # sd between intercepts
s =   0.2   # sd between slopes
r = -0.01   # hardly any relationship between intercepts and slopes
(cov.matrix2 <-  matrix(c(i^2, r * i * s, r * i * s, s^2), nrow = 2, byrow = T))
```

Getting a random sample from this bi-variate normal distribution for each race:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
races = 15
random.effects_races <-  rmvnorm(races, mean = c(0, 0), sigma = cov.matrix2)
```

We establish now the mean of these random intercepts (`alpha_race`) and slopes (`beta_race`):

```{r}
races.df = data.frame(race  = c(1:races)) # Just a column of numbers from 1 to 15
races.df$alpha_races   =    -1 + random.effects_races[, 1]
races.df$beta_races    =     1 + random.effects_races[, 2]
summary(races.df$beta_races)  # The mean is the slope in the fixed effects: 1 + random.effects[,2])
sd(races.df$beta_races)       # The sd of the slopes as random effects (we wanted 0.2)
summary(races.df$alpha_races) # The intercept has a mean of - 1: (Intercept) fixed eff's
sd(races.df$alpha_races) # with a SD intercept as random eff (we wanted 0.8)
cor(races.df$alpha_races, races.df$beta_races) # Set at -0.01.
```

#####THE COVARIATE `AAA` - the fictitious amino acyd:

We need now produce the `[AAA]` with a mean of `50` and a sd of `5` as:

```{r}
observations <- athletes * races
observations.df <-  data.frame(
                    athlete = sort(rep(c(1:athletes), races)),
                    race = rep(c(1:races), athletes), 
                    AAA = rep(rnorm(athletes * races, 50, 5)))
dat1   <-  merge(athletes.df, observations.df)
dat2   <-  merge(dat1, races.df)
dat3   <-  dat2[with(dat2, order(athlete,race)), ]
rownames(dat3)   <-  1:nrow(dat3)
```


#####THE REGRESSOR:

It is time now to calculate the `[Glucose]` values as:

```{r}
df <-  within(dat3, 
       glucose <-  alpha_athletes + AAA * beta_athletes +
                   alpha_races    + AAA * beta_races    +
                   0.75 * rnorm(n = observations)) # Epsilon is 0.75

head(df)
D <- df[,c(2,1,5,8)]
head(D)
```

### THE MODELS:

```{r, warning=F}
m1=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1|athlete), data=D)
coefficients(m1) # 30 intercepts: 1 for every athlete; and one single slope for AAA
m2=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1|athlete) + (0 + AAA|athlete), data=D)
coefficients(m2) # One single intercept but 30 different slopes: 1 / athlete
m3=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1 + AAA|athlete), data=D)
coefficients(m3) # 30 intecepts and 30 different slopes
m4=lmer(glucose ~ AAA * race + (1 + AAA * race|athlete), data=D) 
# 30 intercepts (30 inter'pts from athletes; 30 from race|athlete);
# 30 slopes for AAA; 30 for race
# And the interaction slopes of the AAA*race interaction.
coefficients(m4) 
```
