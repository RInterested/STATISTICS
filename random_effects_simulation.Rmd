### Regression of `[GLUCOSE] ~ [AMINOACID_A]` in 30 athletes after 15 races:

---


```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
set.seed(0)
```

<br>

All the data is fictitious, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/RInterested/SIMULATIONS_and_PROOFS/blob/master/athletes%20mixed%20effects).

<br>

#### Data set "manufacturing" process:

<br>

We'll make the `sd` of the *slopes between athletes* `0.5`, and the `sd` between *intercepts of different athletes* `0.2`. Further we'll establish a *correlation between intercepts and slopes* of `0.8`.

<br>

#### FOR ATHLETES:

<br>

The covariance matrix will be:

```{r}
i = 0.2 # sd between intercepts
s = 0.5 # sd between slopes
r = 0.8 # correlation between intercepts and slopes
# The higher the intercept of an athlete; the higher the slope - could be the opposite...
(cov.matrix1<-  matrix(c(i^2, r * i * s, r * i * s, s^2), nrow = 2, byrow = T))
```


Getting a random sample from this bi-variate normal distribution for each athlete:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
athletes = 30
require(mvtnorm)
random.effects_athletes <-  rmvnorm(athletes, mean = c(0, 0), sigma = cov.matrix1)
```

We establish now the mean of these random intercepts (`alpha_ath`) and slopes (`beta_ath`):

```{r}
athletes.df = data.frame(athlete  = c(1:athletes)) # Just a column of numbers from 1 to 30
athletes.df$alpha_athletes = 1 + random.effects_athletes[, 1]
athletes.df$beta_athletes =  2 + random.effects_athletes[, 2]

summary(athletes.df$beta_athletes)  # The mean is the slope in the fixed effects: 2 + random.effects[,2])
sd(athletes.df$beta_athletes)       # The sd of the slopes as random effects (we wanted 0.5)
summary(athletes.df$alpha_athletes) # The intercept has a mean of 1: (Intercept) fixed eff's
sd(athletes.df$alpha_athletes)      # with a SD intercept as random eff (we wanted 0.2)
cor(athletes.df$alpha_athletes, athletes.df$beta_athletes) # Set at 0.8.
```

<br>

#### FOR RACES:

<br>

The covariance matrix will be:

```{r}
i =   0.8   # sd between intercepts
s =   0.2   # sd between slopes
r = -0.01   # hardly any relationship between intercepts and slopes
(cov.matrix2 <-  matrix(c(i^2, r * i * s, r * i * s, s^2), nrow = 2, byrow = T))
```

Getting a random sample from this bi-variate normal distribution for each race:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
races = 15
random.effects_races <-  rmvnorm(races, mean = c(0, 0), sigma = cov.matrix2)
```

We establish now the mean of these random intercepts (`alpha_race`) and slopes (`beta_race`):

```{r}
races.df = data.frame(race  = c(1:races)) # Just a column of numbers from 1 to 15
races.df$alpha_races   =    -1 + random.effects_races[, 1]
races.df$beta_races    =     1 + random.effects_races[, 2]
summary(races.df$beta_races)  # The mean is the slope in the fixed effects: 1 + random.effects[,2])
sd(races.df$beta_races)       # The sd of the slopes as random effects (we wanted 0.2)
summary(races.df$alpha_races) # The intercept has a mean of - 1: (Intercept) fixed eff's
sd(races.df$alpha_races) # with a SD intercept as random eff (we wanted 0.8)
cor(races.df$alpha_races, races.df$beta_races) # Set at -0.01.
```


<br>

#### THE COVARIATE `AAA` - the fictitious aminoacid:

<br>

We need now produce the `[AAA]` with a mean of `50` and a sd of `5` as:

```{r}
observations <- athletes * races
observations.df <-  data.frame(
                    athlete = sort(rep(c(1:athletes), races)),
                    race = rep(c(1:races), athletes), 
                    AAA = rep(rnorm(athletes * races, 50, 5)))
dat1   <-  merge(athletes.df, observations.df)
dat2   <-  merge(dat1, races.df)
dat3   <-  dat2[with(dat2, order(athlete,race)), ]
rownames(dat3)   <-  1:nrow(dat3)
```

<br>

#### THE RESPONSE VARIABLE:

<br>

It is time now to calculate the `[Glucose]` values as:

```{r}
df <-  within(dat3, 
       glucose <-  alpha_athletes + AAA * beta_athletes +
                   alpha_races    + AAA * beta_races    +
                   0.75 * rnorm(n = observations)) # Epsilon is 0.75

D <- df[,c(2,1,5,8)]
head(D)
```


<br>

## THE MODELS:

<br>

In cursive are lines extracted from [this cross-validated post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/13173/67822).

The most common fix effect is labelled as V2, and the order of the model is altered, but without any essential change to the post on CV.

`M1: V1 ~ V2 + (1|V3)`

*This model will estimate:*
*P1: A global intercept*
*P2: Random effect intercepts for V3 (i.e. for each level of V3, that level's intercept's deviation from the global intercept)*
*P3: A single global estimate for the effect (slope) of V2*



```{r, warning=F}
m1=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1|athlete), data=D)
summary(m1)
coefficients(m1) # 30 intercepts: 1 for every athlete; and one single slope for AAA
```

---

`M2: V1 ~ V2 + (1|V3) + (0 + V2|V3)`

*This model estimates all the parameters from M1, but will additionally estimate:*
*P4: The effect of V2 within each level of V3 (more specifically, the degree to which the V2 effect within a given level deviates from the global effect of V2), while enforcing a zero correlation between the intercept deviations and V2 effect deviations across levels of V3.*


```{r, warning=F}
m2=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1|athlete) + (0 + AAA|athlete), data=D)
summary(m2)
coefficients(m2) # One single intercept but 30 different slopes: 1 / athlete
```

---

`M3: V1 ~ V2 + (1 + V2|V3)`

*All parameters from M2 are estimated while allowing correlation between the intercept deviations and V2 effect deviations within levels of V3. Thus, in M3, an additional parameter is estimated:*
*P5: The correlation between intercept deviations and V2 deviations across levels of V3*
*Usually model pairs like M2 and M3 are computed then compared to evaluate the evidence for correlations between fixed effects (including the global intercept).*

```{r, warning=F}
m3=lmer(glucose ~ AAA + (1 + AAA|athlete), data=D)
summary(m3)
coefficients(m3) # 30 intecepts and 30 different slopes
```

---

`M4: V1 ~ V2 * V4 + (1 + V2 * V4|V3)`

*This model estimates:*
*P1: A global intercept*
*P2: A single global estimate for the effect of V2*
*P3: A single global estimate for the effect of V4*
*P4: A single global estimate for the interaction between V2 and V4*
*P5: Deviations of the intercept from P1 in each level of V3*
*P6: Deviations of the V2 effect from P2 in each level of V3*
*P7: Deviations of the V4 effect from P3 in each level of V3*
*P8: Deviations of the V2-by-V4 interaction from P4 in each level of V3*
*P9 Correlation between P5 and P6 across levels of V3*
*P10 Correlation between P5 and P7 across levels of V3*
*P11 Correlation between P5 and P8 across levels of V3*
*P12 Correlation between P6 and P7 across levels of V3*
*P13 Correlation between P6 and P8 across levels of V3*
*P14 Correlation between P7 and P8 across levels of V3*


```{r, warning=F}
m4=lmer(glucose ~ AAA * race + (1 + AAA * race|athlete), data=D) 
summary(m4)
# 30 intercepts (30 inter'pts from athletes; 30 from race|athlete);
# 30 slopes for AAA; 30 for race
# And the interaction slopes of the AAA*race interaction.
coefficients(m4) 
```
